However, they also simultaneously consume water through transpiration, leading to a carbon-water balance relationship. Agricultural production can be regarded as a form of carbon sequestration behavior. From the perspective of the natural-social-economic complex ecosystem, excessive water usage in food production will aggravate regional water pressure for both domestic and industrial purposes. Hence, achieving a harmonious equilibrium between carbon and water resources during the food production process is a key scientific challenge for ensuring food security and sustainability. Digital intelligence (DI) and cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) are emerging as the new research paradigms that are causing a substantial shift in the conventional thinking and methodologies across various scientific fields, including ecological science and sustainability studies. This paper outlines our recent efforts in using advanced technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), digital twins, metaverses, and parallel intelligence to model, analyze, and manage the intricate dynamics and equilibrium among plants, carbon, and water in arid and semiarid ecosystems. It introduces the concept of the carbon-water balance and explores its management at three levels: the individual plant level, the community level, and the natural-social-economic complex ecosystem level. Additionally, we elucidate the significance of agricultural foundation models as fundamental technologies within this context. A case analysis of water usage shows that, given the limited availability of water resources in the context of the carbon-water balance, regional collaboration and optimized allocation have the potential to enhance the utilization efficiency of water resources in the river basin. A suggested approach is to consider the river basin as a unified entity and coordinate the relationship between the upstream, midstream and downstream areas. Furthermore, establishing mechanisms for water resource transfer and trade among different industries can be instrumental in maximizing the benefits derived from water resources.

However, existing studies do not consider the problem of large differences in pests across multiple growth stages, leading to unsatisfactory performance in pest identification in practical applications. This article proposes a simple framework for multi-stage prediction of pests, which can effectively predict the growth stage of pests and improve pest classification performance. The framework consists of a classification branch and a stage prediction branch. The stage prediction branch predicts the growth stage of pests based on feature similarity using K-Means, and guides the classification branch to classify images from different stages into different categories to avoid interfering with the performance of the classifier. In addition, to update the entire network parameters, we propose a multi-stage cross-entropy loss that optimizes feature extractors and classifiers by fusing image labels and stage prediction outputs. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-stage prediction framework for pest identification can accurately classify pest stages and improve pest classification accuracy. In addition, our work provides research ideas for pest stage prediction and identification, which is expected to help achieve more efficient pest control.;2376-595X;979-8-3503-0442-8;10.1109/CCIS59572.2023.10262999;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10262999;"Deep learning;Pest identification;Multi-stage prediction;Smart agriculture";"Training;Smart agriculture;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Pest control;Feature extraction;Data models";"agriculture;computer vision;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);entropy;feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;pest control";"classification branch;classifiers;computer vision technology;crop pest identification tasks;deep learning techniques;feature extractors;feature similarity;K-means;multistage cross-entropy loss;multistage prediction framework;pest classification accuracy;pest control;pest stage prediction;smart agriculture;stage prediction branch";;;;18;IEEE;2.10.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Early classification and treatment of plant diseases are crucial for maintaining the quality and quantity of crops, and deep learning algorithms have the potential to provide accurate and efficient solutions to this problem. In this study, we used two datasets collected from Mendeley for coffee leaf disease classification. The first dataset contained two classes of images, while the second dataset contained the remaining three types of images. The two datasets were combined to create a more robust dataset for training the two-transfer learning and CNN model. We update the pre-trained model MobileNet and RestNet50 by adding a flattened and dense layer to classify the five types of coffee diseases. The model was trained using 100 epochs, and the performance was evaluated using evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss error for training and validation. The best accuracy was obtained from ResNet50, then MobileNet, and then CNN. The accuracy is 100% for Proposed ResNet50, 98% for CNN, and 99% for MobileNet. To understand the affected areas and help farmers comprehend the reason for the prediction, we used visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++. These techniques generated heat maps of the regions of interest, highlighting the areas that contributed most to the classification decision. Our study highlights the potential of using deep learning techniques for accurate and efficient plant disease detection. By automating the disease classification process, farmers can identify and treat diseases early, leading to better crop yields and quality.

Modern agricultural farming faces great challenges in the cultivation of healthy crops. The “Internet of Things” is a system made up of actuators, sensors, or both that either directly or indirectly connect devices to the Internet. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used in smart farming to improve the standard of agriculture. The foundation of the Indian economy, agriculture, contributes to the country's overall economic growth. Yet, because of the usage of antiquated farming technology and the fact that individuals from rural areas now go to urban areas for more lucrative businesses rather than concentrating on agriculture, the obtained productivity is quite low compared to global standards. This artificial intelligence assists in increasing crop productivity and identifies or keeps track of crop illnesses. based on artificial intelligence to identify crop or leaf diseases, a robot or equipment has been created. It distinguishes or categorizes the plant as either disease-affected or unaffected. Image segmentation is a technique used to isolate the specific disease's affected area.

Our economy mainly relies on agriculture, so this backwardness of technology affects the economy. When we are concerned about agriculture, the main issue that the agriculture sector facing now is, disease identification. Identification of diseases in the correct time can avoid loss of crops and finance of cultivator. Most farmers depend on a traditional method of detection, this method requires enormous amounts of work and time, but correctness of prediction is low. This Paper mainly focuses on disease identification in bell peppers in large farms based on deep learning networks such as Vgg 16, Vgg 19, and AlexNet. Generally, farmers won’t able to find out whether their plant is affected by diseases or not. The spread of diseases affects crop production. Only method to avoid the loss of crop production is by identifying the diseases at its early stage. We do testing based on the image from the different parts of the farm. We also intend to study pre-trained CNN architecture of VGG and AlexNet known as transfer learning, to detect disease detection in bell pepper.

The populations are increasing, and the demand for agricultural products is increasing rapidly. However, in real time, 35% of the agricultural products are wasted due to several reasons. The traditional method is not sufficient to manage the demands. Increasing the fertilisers for a high yield and using harmful pesticides will affect the soil. Therefore, this paper comes with an application created based on different techniques like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. There are certain areas that affect agriculture, like crop disease, water resources, crop monitoring, lack of storage space, and warehouse storage space. This application can solve this problem by utilising the aforementioned technologies. Pesticides have altered the majority of agricultural soils for the worse.

In agricultural fields, various IoT sensors can be utilised to track the important factors that determine productivity. Based on a machine learning model's analysis of the soil's NPK value, the paper seeks to suggest the best crops for the particular field. The entire handling is centred on gathering data for usage by farmers and other collaborators. Farmers in the agriculture industry and IoT devices are increasingly bridging the digital divide. Intelligent greenhouses, which can have hydroponic and micro aquaponic systems, are another application for the Internet of Things. Intelligent greenhouses are becoming more prevalent in cities as they allow for the tracking of many components of fertiliser solutions and enhance plant growth, productivity, and quality. Future food production that is more environmentally friendly will increase output, and the environment will be safeguarded by using water wisely and maximising inputs and treatments. Remote monitoring, decision-support tools, automatic irrigation systems, frost prevention, fertilising, and other methods are all part of smart agriculture. IoT technology, which consists of hardware, intelligent software, integration platforms, monitoring strategies, operating systems, and cloud computing, enables these procedures.;;979-8-3503-2388-7;10.1109/ICDT57929.2023.10151422;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10151422;"Smart agriculture;IoT sensors;KMP value;Machine learning model;intelligent greenhouses;micro aquaponic systems;operating systems;and cloud computing";"Smart agriculture;Productivity;Cloud computing;Urban areas;Crops;Greenhouses;Soil";"agriculture;cloud computing;crops;fertilisers;food products;greenhouses;Internet of Things;irrigation;learning (artificial intelligence);soil";"agricultural areas;agricultural fields;agricultural nations;agricultural problems;agriculture industry;intelligent greenhouses;IoT devices;IoT sensors;IoT technology;IoT-enabled precision agriculture;nation;smart agriculture;smart farming";;;;16;IEEE;19.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Agriculture is the process of working on the ground, planting seeds and growing the crops. Nowadays only few are involved in farming it is because of the increasing of the cost for the pesticides, seeds and equipment, and also increasing of the man power. The major drawback in agriculture field is due to reducing of the crop yield. It is because of lack of awareness towards soil i.e., which crop should be grown on particular area. All these factors will make the farmers not to do the farming in an efficient way. This paper proposes Solar based multipurpose agriculture robot using Random Forest Algorithm. This system will reduce the manpower and increase the crop yield. This proposed system will do operations like seed sowing, pesticide spraying, solar panel for getting the energy to run the robot etc. The total work should be done with a most emerging technology like Machine learning.

However, to meet this demand and the exponential growth of the population, farmers need water to irrigate their property. Farmers require a fix that modifies their business practices because of the scarcity of using this resource. To keep up with and satisfy Demand, Agriculture 4.0 has become a reality thanks to new technologies. Automated Irrigation: Smart irrigation systems can automatically adjust schedules based on real-time data, such as weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and evapotranspiration rates. This helps farmers apply water more efficiently, reducing water waste and improving crop health. By collecting and analysing agricultural information through a combination of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, decisions have become increasingly precise to make decision-making easier. A cost-effective, intelligent, and adaptable irrigation strategy that can be used in a variety of settings is presented in this paper. For smart agriculture, machine learning algorithms are the foundation for this strategy. MongoDB and the Node-RED platform were used. We created an acquisition map from a collection of sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and rain) in a setting that guaranteed improved plant development for months.

Farmers cultivate the same crops over and over again without experimenting with new varieties, and they apply fertilisers in arbitrary amounts without knowing how much of it is insufficient in either nutrients or quantity. Thus, this has a direct impact on crop output in addition to causing soil acidity and top layer damage. This paper proposed a model to benefit farmers by utilising machine learning techniques. The system also provides information on the kinds and quantities of seeds and fertilisers required for production. This method will suggest the best crop for a particular plot of land based on soil parameters and meteorological circumstances.

Most existing defense strategies defend against adversarial examples based on full information of whole images. In reality, one possible reason as to why humans are not sensitive to adversarial perturbations is that the human visual mechanism often concentrates on most important regions of images. A deep attention mechanism has been applied in many computer fields and has achieved great success. Attention modules are composed of an attention branch and a trunk branch. The encoder/decoder architecture in the attention branch has potential of compressing adversarial perturbations. In this article, we theoretically prove that attention modules can compress adversarial perturbations by destroying potential linear characteristics of DNNs. Considering the distribution characteristics of adversarial perturbations in different frequency bands, we design and compare three types of attention modules based on frequency decomposition and reorganization to defend against adversarial examples. Moreover, we find that our designed attention modules can obtain high classification accuracies on clean images by locating attention regions more accurately. Experimental results on the CIFAR and ImageNet dataset demonstrate that frequency reorganization in attention modules can not only achieve good robustness to adversarial perturbations, but also obtain comparable, even higher classification, accuracies on clean images. Moreover, our proposed attention modules can be integrated with existing defense strategies as components to further improve adversarial robustness.;2162-2388;;10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3113342;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61825203,U1736203,61732021,61906074,61675003,61972178); Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Research Project(grant numbers:2019B030302008); National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005600); Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2017B010111005); Leading Talents of Guangdong Province Program(grant numbers:2016LJ06G689); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B020214003); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202103000090); Key-Areas of Artificial Intelligence in General Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019KZDZX1012); Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture Project(grant numbers:NT2021009); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011276); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:21620432); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B1515120010); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604767;"Adversarial examples;deep attention mechanism;frequency decomposition;image classification";"Perturbation methods;Robustness;Image coding;Training;Neural networks;Task analysis;Research and development";"deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)";"adversarial examples;adversarial perturbations;attention branch;clean images;deep attention mechanism;deep attention network;deep neural networks;designed attention modules;existing defense strategies;improve adversarial robustness;locating attention regions";"Humans;Distillation;Neural Networks, Computer";2;;78;IEEE;5.11.2021;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

According to its definition, a wireless sensor network is a collection of sensor nodes that link to one another and/or with a node outside of their coverage area via wireless communication. These nodes frequently have one or more sensors for evaluating internal or external elements as well as environmental characteristics. A CPU then controls the sensors, compiling, storing, processing, and, if requested, transmitting the data. In some systems, the sensor nodes' processing power is constrained to make them more energy-efficient. In this application, the sensor nodes transfer the collected data to a remote node with more powerful processing capabilities and greater storage in specified time intervals or condition-based events storage. Because of its ability to monitor processes at a small scale, nanotechnology is regarded as a leading technology for controlling agriculture. So, it paves the way for crucial advantages such as improving food quality and quantity, lowering the input needed for agricultural production, fully utilizing soil nutrients, etc. The availability of natural resources, detecting the right nutrients from the soil for crop-specific production, and crop cultivation are issues in these models. In order to boost crop yield by assessing the nutrients in the soil, various nano-sensors are used in this research study.

Along with a few strategies for expediting product delivery and including a better driver software architecture in the driver software, he explains these strategies. A sizable portion of India's economy is focused on the food industry. The great majority of individuals in this area rely mostly on agricultural produce for their income, which benefits the whole community. The development of food, which is fundamental for human food, is heavily influenced by ranchers. The sales reps are attempting to decide the right selling cost for the offers they are giving. The misfortunes of this organization outperform its benefits. As indicated by the financial exchange hypothesis referenced above, ranchers are allowed to sell their wares at the most elevated offer cost. Ranchers that sign up in this manner will approach different administrations, including assessments, distributer correspondence, market warnings, and different elements and benefits of a comparable kind. Predictive analytics may be used in many other industries, such as expert device manufacture (which might include voice recognition and artificial vision), judicial assessment, and a number of others. Precision agriculture, automated weapons systems (such as drones), and judicial precedent analysis are a few examples. The adoption of artificial intelligence agricultural methods will help alleviate the challenge of the rising global food demand.

Sustainable agriculture, in light of expected population expansion, must ensure food security while remaining economically and socially viable and having a minimal impact on biodiversity and natural ecosystems. Deep learning has shown to be an advanced method for analyzing large amounts of data, having applications in fields as diverse as image processing and object recognition. Recently, it’s being used in the fields of food engineering and science. Food recognition, quality detection of produce, meat, and seafood, the food supply chain, and contamination were only some of the problems these systems set out to solve. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a common tool in the field of precision agriculture for making predictions about the quality of harvested crops. This is especially true when assessing crops at various post-harvest stages. Certain postharvest diseases or damages, like rot, can completely wipe out crops and even produce toxins that are hazardous to humans, making disease and damage identification a top priority. Preprocessing with a gabor filter, enhancement with HE, segmentation with a K-means algorithm, and feature extraction with LBP and BIC make up the suggested method. Lastly, DB-KELM is used to train the model. As compared to ELM and KELM, the proposed method performs better.;;979-8-3503-3360-2;10.1109/ICSCSS57650.2023.10169197;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10169197;"Gabor Filter (GF);Distance Based (DB);Multiple Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MKELM)";"Supply chains;Sociology;Crops;Agriculture;Real-time systems;Gabor filters;Artificial intelligence";"agriculture;artificial intelligence;contamination;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);ecology;feature extraction;food processing industry;food products;food safety;food security;Gabor filters;object recognition;plant diseases;sustainable development";"artificial intelligence;BIC;biodiversity;contamination;crops;DB-KELM;deep learning;food recognition;food security;food supply chain;fruits;K-means algorithm;LBP;MKELM approach;natural ecosystems;postharvest diseases;real-time quality assurance;seafood;sustainable agriculture;sustainable development;vegetables";;;;27;IEEE;7.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Hence, DA has emerged as a new catalyst for grain productivity and a driving force behind climate improvement, with broad prospects. However, digital agriculture is still in its early stage in most countries and there are few systematic reviews. In China, for example, there were only 3 non-core reviews out of 817 literatures on DA. Meanwhile, the use of Citespace is revolutionary as it leverages data visualization to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within literatures, aiding researchers in achieving their objectives. This study aims to address this research gap by using Citespace to produce a non-subjective and testable review on DA. In this study, we collected 2264 literatures by retrieving the WoS database in the timespan 1997-2022. The results show that 1) over time, the annual number of publications on DA has gradually increased and the research can be roughly divided into three stages: start-up, steady development, and rapid development stage; 2) research streams of DA can be further divided into six categories: Remote Sensing, Climate-Smart Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data and System Integration; 3) development of research frontiers could be divided into three parts: “exploration of digital agriculture technologies,” “operation management of digital agriculture” and “limitations of digital agriculture;” 4) future research should pay more attention to the innovation and scientific evaluation of digital technology and operation management.

Humidity changes are complex, dynamic, and nonlinear. Accurately predicting humidity values and analyzing their changing trends is crucial to the growth of pigeons. Addressing low prediction accuracy and poor generalization of traditional humidity prediction methods, this paper proposes a combination based on partial least squares (PLS) data dimensionality reduction, Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter, and sparrow optimization algorithm (SSA) Predictive models to improve humidity forecast accuracy. First, the SG filter is used for data smoothing to remove abnormal noise in the data signal to enhance the feature learning ability of the prediction system. Next, the original data is selected through the PLS method to select information higher than the set threshold. Valuable information features are extracted for data dimensionality reduction. In addition, SSA is used to optimize key parameters and structure of the BiGRU model for improved prediction. Finally, a combined prediction model based on SG-PLS-SSA-BiGRU was built to simulate and predict the humidity of the pigeon house.

We can do this by using a variety of strategies, such availability plans, that enable us to maintain the greatest levels of quality, just as the software team was able to. He talks about these approaches, as well as a few more, for delivering top-notch printer software designs quickly. India has a big food-related industry, principal means of support.

Even while making enhancements, we will consider how the six comparable design components may ensure that the finished product has the highest possible quality in the shortest period of time possible. Giving excellent goods quickly and doing them effectively are both essential. To do this, we may use a range of strategies, such as unavailability techniques, which enable us to maintain the highest level of accuracy that our team of engineers is capable of. He discusses these methods and a few options for the goods’ distribution. Using this stock market idea, growers can sell their goods at the highest bidder pricing. Farmers that fill out this form may register themselves and have access to a variety of facilities, such as market alerts, merchant engagement, assessments, and more. The creation of knowledge devices, automated weapon systems,[1] language comprehension, computer vision, legal analysis, and agricultural monitoring are just a few examples of the many uses for data modelling. The problem of the expanding global agricultural output will be addressed by the employment of Al in contemporary agriculture. Based on Al, it should be easy to recognise and quickly identify plants, and judgments on the appropriate chemical to apply and the necessary safe zone might be made quickly.

Yet, plant-related illnesses are the most difficult obstacle for farmers to overcome. The leaf is the portion of the plant that is noticed the most, but the process of segmenting an image of a sick lesion on a leaf suffers from challenges related to uneven lighting and a crowded, complicated natural environment. The combination of colour balancing and superpixel is the foundation of the approach that has been suggested as a solution to these issues. To begin, the picture that is being read in will be converted into a color-balanced image so that the effects of uneven lighting may be removed. Second, using the superpixel operation, compact areas are produced from the modified picture. An experimentally calculated threshold is then applied to the Histogram of Gradients (HOG) and colour channels of the superpixel to separate the undesirable backdrop from the image of the leaf. In order to identify a sick or contaminated picture, K-means clustering is employed. Pyramid of HOG (PHOG), an expanded version of HOG, together with Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) characteristics are used to depict a sick infected portion of the body. In the end, many disease classifiers are evaluated against one another, and Random Forest (RF) is chosen as the best option. An experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach’s accuracy using natural photographs obtained from a variety of farms, images downloaded from the internet, and the Plant-Village colour dataset.

So, that’s why good crop yield is very important to get high agricultural output. A single disease in a plant can lower crop yield. So, to maintain a high agricultural output, we need to detect disease at the early stage so that the agricultural output should be maintained. There are multiple ways to detect plant disease like detecting a plant disease by using the naked eye by hiring an expert, or by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). By using AI, it takes less time to detect plant disease as compared to detecting using the naked eye. Deep Learning (DL), the sub-branch of AI gives an accurate result as compared to the other sub-branches of AI. In DL, Convolutional Neural Network or CovNet is the latest and revolutionary algorithm to perform this task.

The use of drones in agriculture offers significant economic and time-saving benefits. The evaluation of UAVs’ performance is urgently needed in light of their proliferation in agriculture during the past few decades. This evaluation falls under the complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem due to the existence of multicriteria, criteria importance, and trade-offs or conflicts amongst them. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to offer an integrated fuzzy MCDM approach based on two significant methods. The first method is the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) method for calculating the UAV criteria (i.e., payload, endurance, and dimensions) weight coefficients. The second method is the fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) for UAV alternative selection based on individual and group decision-making (GDM) settings. The decision matrix used in the selection approach of UAV categories is formulated based on the intersection of payload, endurance, and dimensions criteria and the UAV alternatives list. The findings show that (1) the FWZIC has effectively determined the criteria weights with a zero inconsistency rate. The maximum weight value is given to the payload criterion (0.428), whereas the dimension criterion was given the least value weight (0.199). (2) In the context of GDM, FDOSM is used to eliminate the dissimilarity between individual MCDM results across all categories of UAV. Finally, objective validation and sensitivity analysis were utilized to evaluate the strength of UAV selection results.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3294094;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10177736;"Drone;FWZIC;FDOSM;multicriteria decision-making;agriculture;UAV";"Agriculture;Payloads;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Drones;Sensors;Costs;Analytic hierarchy process";"agriculture;autonomous aerial vehicles;decision making;fuzzy set theory;sensitivity analysis";"complex multicriteria decision-making problem;conventional farming practices;criteria weights;decision matrix;dimension criterion;FDOSM;fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency method;FWZIC;individual MCDM results;integrated fuzzy decision-making approach;integrated fuzzy MCDM approach;maximum weight value;opinion score method;payload criterion;precision agriculture;selection approach;time-saving benefits;UAV alternative selection;UAV alternatives list;UAV categories;UAV criteria;UAV selection results;unmanned aerial vehicle;value weight;zero inconsistency rate;zero-inconsistency method";;1;;77;CCBYNCND;10.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Moreover, the algorithm must also consider the limited energy capacity of the ABSs. The results show that our proposed approach outperforms several heuristics and the classic Q-Learning approach. Furthermore, we provide a mixed integer linear programming solution to determine a lower bound on the performance, and clarify the gap between our risk-sensitive solution and the optimal solution, as well. The comparison proves our extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method is a promising approach for providing a guaranteed task processing services for the IoT tasks in a smart farm, while increasing the hovering time of the ABSs in this farm.;2473-2400;;10.1109/TGCN.2022.3205330;"NSERC Canada Research Chairs; MITACS Accelerate Programs; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9882524;"Energy efficient computation offload;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);aerial base station (ABS);smart farm;risksensitive reinforcement learning;Internet of Things (IoT)";"Task analysis;Smart agriculture;Internet of Things;Delays;Intelligent sensors;Energy consumption;Batteries";"agriculture;autonomous aerial vehicles;integer programming;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;reinforcement learning;scheduling";"ABS task scheduling;ABSs;advanced solution;aerial base stations;classic Q-Learning approach;computing resources;energy capacity;guaranteed task;IoT devices;IoT tasks;IoT-aerial base station task offloading;mixed integer linear programming solution;novel multiactor-based risk-sensitive reinforcement learning approach;offload processing responsibility;optimal solution;risk-sensitive solution;smart agriculture;smart farm;things devices";;1;;29;IEEE;9.9.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

By 2050, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, requiring a 70 percent increase in global food production. Traditional agricultural practices are becoming increasingly inefficient and unreliable because of several issues, including soil degradation, water stress, nutrition shortage, insufficient infrastructure linkages, post-harvest loss, and information asymmetry. However, detrimental climate change is one of the most severe concerns confronting this industry. Thus, smart farming or digital agriculture is now regarded as a far more sustainable practice as it includes the management of farms via edge cutting technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, big data etc. to maximize the quantity and quality of crops while minimizing the abundance of human work needed. It entails using sensors and automated irrigation procedures to monitor agricultural land, temperature, soil moisture, pH level, etc. Employing these technologies increases profitability, decreases waste, and preserves environmental quality. Although the smart agriculture business is expanding rapidly due to the world’s growing population and rising food consumption, this field still has a scope of academic literature. This paper aims to describe the different cutting-edge technologies currently being used in smart farming, their use cases, and their future directions. For this paper, a case study technique has been employed to study several technologies and their prospects in this endeavor. This study will be helpful to academicians and Government officials that can further help farmers to create a smart and more sustainable agriculture industry.;;978-1-6654-9199-0;10.1109/ICSCDS56580.2023.10105101;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105101;"Agriculture;Robotics;Internet of Things;automation;Artificial Intelligence";"Smart agriculture;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Service robots;Sociology;Robot sensing systems;Internet of Things";"agriculture;artificial intelligence;Big Data;crops;economic indicators;food products;Internet of Things;irrigation;soil";"70 percent increase;agricultural land;big data etc;detrimental climate change;different cutting-edge technologies;digital agriculture;efficiency 70.0 percent;future potentials;GDP growth;global food production;Indian economy;insufficient infrastructure linkages;more sustainable agriculture industry;post-harvest loss;robotics;smart agriculture business;smart agriculture industry;smart farming;soil degradation;sustainable practice;traditional agricultural practices;world";;1;;17;IEEE;25.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

One of these tasks is detecting diseases in plants since plant diseases is now a topic of interest as it highly affects the crop yield production. Egypt in fact is one of the main countries that should consider plant disease detection for a productive crop yield since Egypt heavily relies on agriculture as it’s income. Moreover, other countries also rely on the crops exported from Egypt such as oranges, as Egypt is considered one of the largest orange exporters in the world. Therefore, deep learning was stated as the current effective approach in smart agriculture to help tackle the crop yield reduction crisis that are caused due to the neglection of plant diseases and the standard visual inspecting techniques used for detecting plant diseases. In this paper different deep learning Convolution Neural Network approaches are proposed using the new plant diseases dataset which consists of 38 classes of 14 types of healthy and diseased crop leaf images to help detect diseases in plants effectively and efficiently. The first proposed approach is a Convolution Neural Network model consisting of four convolution and pooling layers in addition to two fully connected layers and an output layer with 38 neurons for each of the 38 classes which resulted in an accuracy of 98.36%, loss of 0.0972, 98.35% F1 score, 98.36% recall, 98.39% precision, model size of 12.25mb, training time of 22.82 seconds, and total parameters of 668, 134.

This makes its yield prediction essential for both economics and sustainability. The potential cotton yield can be predicted by integrating climatic factors, soil parameters, and biophysical parameters observed by high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing satellites. This study used a multisource dataset to create an explainable and accurate predictive model for cotton yield prediction over the continental United States (CONUS). A recently proposed glass-box method called explainable boosting machine (EBM), which provides transparency, reliability, and ease of interpretation, was implemented. Accuracy performance was compared with the common machine learning (ML) methods for predicting cotton yields. The EBM showed higher accuracy against other glass-box methods and competitive results with black-box models. With the help of the EBM, the importance of individual features and their pairwise interactions was revealed without applying any post hoc methods. The study findings showed that precipitation (P), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) are the three most important dynamic features. The dynamic features are the driver of the created model with 78% of the overall feature importance, followed by pairwise interactions of the features with 16% contribution. Finally, static features contribute 6% to the overall feature importance. The study highlights the importance of using multisource data and interactions of the input features and providing an interpretable model to understand the inner dynamics of cotton yield predictions.;1558-0571;;10.1109/LGRS.2023.3303643;"2022 Climate Change AI Innovation Grants Program, Hosted by Climate Change AI with the additional support of Canada Hub of Future Earth(grant numbers:182); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(grant numbers:122Y102); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214067;"Agriculture;cotton;explainable boosting machine (EBM);feature selection;glass-box method;interpretability;explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);yield estimation";"Crops;Cotton;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Production;Glass box;Spatial resolution";"artificial intelligence;cotton;crops;ecology;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);soil;vegetation mapping";"biophysical parameters;climate chnage;climatic factors;common machine learning methods;continental United States;cotton yield prediction;cotton yields;EBM;ecosystem change;explainable artificial intelligence;explainable boosting machine;feature importance;glass-box method;global textile industry;high temporal resolution remote sensing satellites;leaf area index;multisource data;pairwise interactions;potential cotton yield;predictive model;soil parameters;spatial resolution remote sensing satellites";;;;28;IEEE;9.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Therefore, we propose automatic rice seedling labeling from a UAV image system based on YOLOv4. Many studies have shown great performance in object recognition from images. However, detecting small targets such as rice seedlings in UAV images is more difficult than traditional object recognition. In addition, the small number of data is also a problem to improve performance. Therefore, applying YOLOv4 and using the dataset from the AIdea contest in 2021, the proposed model is trained with the original UAV image data for data augmentation to detect small objects.

Citrus is a plant genus that may produce fruit that has a high market value and is thus cultivated and harvested in large quantities all over the world. The cultivation of citrus, however, has been significantly hampered by the presence of a number diseases, which has resulted in significant decreases in both productivity and quality. The detection and classification of plant diseases has been greatly aided by the development of machine learning and computer vision in recent years. This improvement came about in recent years. Although machine learning models make use of a wide variety of methods for identification and prediction, it would appear that study into the deep learning (DL) area offers the most potential for boosting accuracy as a result of the confluence of these two fields. This research makes use of a two- stage deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in order to analyse leaf images for the purpose of identifying plant diseases and classifying citrus diseases. Using a region proposal network, the proposed model will first identify potential target diseased areas, and then it will use a classifier to assign the most likely target area to the right disease class.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a disease detection system based on K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to prevent large-scale spread of avian influenza. We used decrease in feed intake and a decrease in egg laying rate, which are the main symptoms of avian influenza when it outbreaks, as the standard data for the system's decision. If avian influenza is suspected according to the data analysis result, a push message is sent to the farmer's cell phone, and the farmer checks the information on the area suspected of avian influenza through the application linked with the system and transmits it to the server of the national livestock quarantine system. This is how the system is designed to work.

The main obstacle to food security is population expansion leading to rising demand for food. Farmers must produce more on the same land to boost the supply. Through crop yield prediction, technology can assist farmers in producing more. This paper’s primary goal is to predict crop yield utilizing the variables of rainfall, crop, meteorological conditions, area, production, and yield that have posed a serious threat to the long-term viability of agriculture. Crop yield prediction is a decision-support tool that uses machine learning and deep learning that can be used to make decisions about which crops to produce and what to do in the crop’s growing season. It can decide which crops to produce and what to do in the crop’s growing season. Regardless of the distracting environment, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are utilized in crop selection to reduce agricultural yield output losses. To estimate the agricultural yield, machine learning techniques: decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost regression; deep learning techniques - convolutional neural network and long-short term memory network have been used. Accuracy, root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, standard deviation, and losses are compared. Other machine learning and deep learning methods fall short compared to the random forest and convolutional neural network. The random forest has a maximum accuracy of 98.96%, mean absolute error of 1.97, root mean square error of 2.45, and standard deviation of 1.23. The convolutional neural network has been evaluated with a minimum loss of 0.00060. Consequently, a model is developed that, compared to other algorithms, predicts the yield quite well.

However, maize production is jeopardized by many diseases that may reduce output and decrease grain quality. Traditional disease detection and control procedures have had slight effectiveness, prompting the development of new tactics to assure long-term maize production. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) developments, notably convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in crop disease identification and diagnosis. Nonetheless, the decentralized structure of agriculture poses difficulties for traditional CNNs, which need centralized data for training. Federated learning (FL), a distributed learning paradigm, overcomes these issues by allowing model training on decentralized, private data. In this work, to explore the efficacy of an FL CNN model in recognizing and diagnosing maize illnesses using a dataset of 9,586 maize leaf pictures from diverse farms and locations with varied disease categories and severity levels. The suggested FL CNN model outperformed traditional CNNs and other machine learning approaches typically used in agriculture regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in identifying and categorizing maize illnesses and their severity levels. The FL method can increase disease diagnosis, adjust to geographical changes, and protect data privacy, making it a viable option for real-world maize disease detection and management.;;979-8-3503-3324-4;10.1109/ICCPCT58313.2023.10245725;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10245725;"Maize diseases;Federated learning;Convolutional neural networks;Image classification;Disease detection;Severity Levels";"Training;Data privacy;Federated learning;Crops;Agriculture;Data models;Convolutional neural networks";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);plant diseases";"agriculture breakthrough;agriculture regarding accuracy;animal feed;artificial intelligence developments;control procedures;convolutional neural networks;crop disease identification;decentralized data;disease diagnosis;distributed learning paradigm;F1-score;federated ConvNets;federated learning;FL CNN model;FL method;grain quality;long-term maize production;machine learning;maize illnesses;maize leaf pictures;model training;private data;raw materials;real-world maize disease detection;severity estimation;severity levels;unprecedented maize disease detection;varied disease categories";;;;13;IEEE;22.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

First, the finite-element simulation method was used to simulate the airflow impact model and optimize the ranges of the angle and distance parameters. The detection device was then developed, and binocular 3-D phenotype acquisition and 3-D feature extraction algorithms were investigated. Denoising, point cloud segmentation, greedy projection triangulation, Delaunay triangulation, and surface fitting algorithms were used to process the point cloud, and concave parameters, such as depth, mapping area, surface area, and volume of the concave area on the beef surface, were obtained. Finally, four typical samples with different meat (beef and chicken) and fruit (kiwifruit and peach) parameters were tested. Five machine-learning methods were used to model and analyze the correlation among texture parameters.

Here the suggestive approach is to design and implementation of a robotics mechanism that holds records of plants-health, and environmental conditions, and the effective use of pesticides as per need should be monitored in real-time. Since the existing geographical conditions for agriculture plants and their proper growth depend on either sufficient rainfall or a good water supply with better knowledge of the fertilization process suited as per fertility of the land. In India during cultivation very few farmers are going for the fertility test of their lands, hence without knowing the actual indexed value it is exceedingly difficult to the prediction of fertilizer mixing & use of different types. Therefore, many such farmers do work on belief in the knowledge of ancient ways of traditional cultivation. This is the root cause of failure in agriculture where the crops are not getting proper nutrition, which results in a minimal amount of production & loss of crops. According to one of the case studies of rice cultivation types, such as transplantation, drilling, Japanese, and broadcast methods. Pesticides have been used mainly for the protection of plants as well as humans from malaria, dengue, and fever. In the Indian pesticide industry investment in pesticides in 2019 is over 73 billion Indian rupees. Different types of pesticides have been used for farming such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, etc. the effect of pesticides on the fertility of crops and land is due to the hard treatment of soil with pesticides causing the population of soil microorganisms to decrease.

A cutting-edge method to address current difficulties with agricultural sustainability is known as precision agriculture. For effectively managing agricultural land it is a must to monitor it. By deploying the nodes, this task becomes easy. To facilitate effective information transmission, these nodes gather and transmit the data. Localizing the nodes becomes essential during data transfer. Aside from that, these networks are quite dynamic, and conventional localization methods are inadequate to address the problems brought on by quickly moving sensor nodes. As a result, machine learning (ML) approaches are used to solve these problems quickly and effectively. This paper provides a detailed discussion of precision agriculture (PA), the need for localization and ML algorithms in PA, and their limitations.;;978-1-6654-7491-7;10.1109/DICCT56244.2023.10110233;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10110233;"Localization;WSN;Machine Learning;Precision Agriculture";"Location awareness;Machine learning algorithms;Sociology;Machine learning;Information processing;Agriculture;Statistics";"agriculture;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless sensor networks";"agricultural land;agricultural sustainability;conventional localization methods;current difficulties;cutting-edge method;effective information transmission;frequent climate change;machine learning approaches;nodes gather;population expansion;precision agriculture;resource constraints;sensor nodes";;;;23;IEEE;1.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

With the support of edge computing environments, providing latency guaranteed AI as a Service (AIaaS) can accelerate the deployment of data-intensive and computation-intensive AI applications and reduce the investment cost of the customers. However, the deployment architecture and working mechanism design, and performance optimization problems specific for AIaaS with configurable data quality and model complexity have not been studied in existing works. To address the problem, we propose a configurable model deployment architecture (CMDA) for edge AIaaS and present a flexible working mechanism by enabling the joint configuration of data quality ratios (DQRs) and model complexity ratios (MCRs) for the AI tasks.

In the proposed algorithm, a preprocessing phase is adopted that includes segmented fields splitting and merging, to shrink the operation field number (i.e., multi-UASs total sorties) and ensure that each generated field area remains smaller than (but close to) the unmanned aerial system (UAS) maximum single-sortie operation area. An improved one-sortie coverage path generation model is established, avoiding power waste in the case when UAS needs to operate on more than one subfield in one sortie. The integer PSO is then used to optimize the initial assignment for UASs on multibases, with the purpose of reducing total operation time and nonoperation flight distance of overall coverage path planning. The proposed algorithm solves the problems of how to design pesticide spraying coverage path on segmented agricultural fields with several bases, and allocate to multiple plant protection UASs with constrained loading capacity. Computer simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the performance compared with other algorithms. The test results show that the total number of flight sorties using nested GA (53) is smaller than that using some representative metaheuristic algorithms (57), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (60), and traditional planning methods (83). Both nonoperation distance and total operation time obtained by nest GA and integer PSO are smaller than those using other planning methods.

The prediction approaches have evolved from traditional statistical methods, conventional machine learning methods, deep learning (DL) methods, and then hybrid deep learning methods. This article proposes ElectricityTalk, an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for smart farms, which integrates the artificial intelligence (AI) mechanism with farming IoT devices for electric energy prediction and anomaly detection. The AI mechanism called AItalk is designed with modified convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory models. Traditional electric energy prediction approaches only consider the information provided by smart meters. This article shows that with the extra IoT switch status information in the smart farm and postprocessing with a simple yet novel random walk model, the performance of ElectricityTalk is significantly improved (by 34.5%) as compared with the AI mechanism without the farming IoT switch information. We show that the mean absolute percentage error of AItalk is 8.62% (for the UCI dataset) and 1.53% (for the Bao farm dataset), which outperforms the previous solutions. We also show that ElectricityTalk detects all anomalies in real farm operations, and can achieve recall of 1 and precision larger than 0.994, which also outperforms the previous solutions.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have powerful image classification capabilities. This research paper introduces a novel method to classify apple leaf diseases into four severity levels using federated learning and CNNs, aiming to harness the privacy-preserving nature and decentralized training benefits of federated learning. To replicate a federated learning environment, we created a large dataset of 8,973 labelled apple leaf photos representing a range of disease categories and severity levels. We then disseminated the data among four clients. Our decentralized training process allowed for the efficient use of various datasets and data privacy protection for our federated learning CNN model.

These may cause serious damage to crops which in turn ends in large losses for the farmers. It is difficult for the field owners to build physical barriers to entire field and monitor it. The existing systems is mainly based on observation. Farmers take actions according to the animal that entered their filed. The other ways farmers use to prevent the crop destruction by virtue of animals include constructing barricades, electrical fences, and manual surveillance.

Multisource Maximum Predictor Discrepancy for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Corn Yield Prediction;"Y. Ma; Z. Yang; Z.

However, due to the domain shift between heterogeneous regions, supervised ML models tend to have poor spatial transferability. As a result, models trained with labeled data from one spatial region (i.e., source domain) often lose their validity when directly applied to another region (i.e., target domain). To address this issue, we proposed a multisource maximum predictor discrepancy (MMPD) neural network that is an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach for corn yield prediction at the county level. The novelties of this study include that: 1) we proposed to maximize the discrepancy between two source-specific yield predictors and align source and target domains by considering crop yield response in the target domain and 2) we adopted the strategy of multisource UDA to avoid negative interference between labeled samples from different sources. Case studies in the U.S. corn belt and Argentina demonstrated that the proposed MMPD model had effectively reduced domain shifts and outperformed several other state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and UDA methods.;1558-0644;;10.1109/TGRS.2023.3247343;"United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Project(grant numbers:1028199); United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Project(grant numbers:1028199); University of Wisconsin–Madison, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education with funding from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049448;"Crop yield prediction;deep learning (DL);multisource domain;satellite remote sensing (RS);unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)";"Feature extraction;Task analysis;Predictive models;Crops;Biological system modeling;Data models;Adaptation models";"artificial intelligence;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;supervised learning;unsupervised learning";"align source;artificial intelligence techniques;corn belt;corn yield prediction;crop yield prediction;crop yield response;domain shift;heterogeneous regions;MMPD model;multisource maximum predictor discrepancy neural network;multisource UDA;observation data;poor spatial transferability;remote sensing;satellite missions;source domain;source-specific yield predictors;spatial region;supervised machine learning methods;supervised ML models;target domain;target domains;unsupervised domain adaptation approach";;;;70;IEEE;22.2.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

The proposed solutions include model transfer between years without retraining and secondly, developing models with limited training samples. The research evaluates the performance of Random Forest (RF) and three deep learning (DL) algorithms: Long Short-Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN), InceptionTime, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). All four algorithms are evaluated initially with abundant ground samples and later with smaller sample sizes (100, 300, 500 and 1000 samples). Model transferability is tested across years. The impact of S1 image count on transfer accuracy is examined. Additionally, the effect of the phenological shift in the rapeseed growth cycle of 15 and 30 days between the training and test years was also investigated. The findings demonstrate strong model performance when training and testing occur in the same year (F1-score up to 95%). Within sample sizes of 300 to 1000, RF and InceptionTime stand out with high accuracy (F1-score>90%). When employing different years for training and testing with abundant sample sizes, all four algorithms correctly classified rapeseed (F1-score between 85.5% and 92.7%). In cases of a reduced number of images, the performance of InceptionTime and LSTM-FCN decreased (16% decrease in the F1-score), while RF and MLP maintain their performance. Notably, RF outperforms DL algorithms with an F1-score of 89.1%.

In our country, agriculture is one of the most significant economic sectors. The agriculture sector, however, has several difficulties, such as the different climatic conditions in other regions of our country that give rise to various infectious diseases in different plant species, resulting in a significant drop in crop productivity and income generation. Early and accurate plant disease diagnosis is crucial in improving the foundation for harvest formation. The traditional method of plant disease detection through eye observation is unsuccessful since it necessitates knowledge. Machine learning (ML) techniques are being utilized to identify and categorize plant ailments to address this issue. In this work, plant diseases can be classified using machine learning methods. These involve classifier training, classification, and stages like dataset construction, image loading, pre-processing, segmentation, and feature extraction. An artificial neural network is initially used to distinguish and find leaves in a challenging environment. The Chan-Vese (CV) technique states that symptoms can be found in images that have been segmented depending on the outcomes of the ANN algorithm. A transfer learning model trained on a dataset of ill leaves on an essential background is then given the segmented leaves. The model is also checked for rust, black rot, and bacterial plaque conditions. The findings demonstrate that the methodology is more accurate—98.22%—than the previous approach, minimizing the adverse effects of illness on agricultural productivity and promoting long-term agrarian growth. Utilizing data from PlantVillage, the model is trained and validated. The dataset includes images of plant diseases afflicting pepper, tomato, and potato plants.

One of the staple food sources is rice, which is derived from paddy. In the development of the times there have been many technologies which helps in the world of agriculture, one of which is Smart Farming which uses Internet of Things (IoT). Pests are a social and economic problem for the community. Although insects and rodents can be controlled using pesticides, larger pests such as wild boar, warthog, porcupine and birds cannot be controlled using these methods because requires human effort to keep them away from the plants.

Recently, smart farming has been widely used to monitor corn to improve the quality and quantity of production. However, pests are still a major problem in corn smart farming. This is because the existing corn smart farming still has low pest detection accuracy. This research provides a solution to the problem by developing an IOT-based intelligent pest detection system for corn smart farming. The system developed uses a machine learning algorithm for detecting a pest that is tracked through a camera connected to an IOT device. The camera works based on the trigger given by a Passive Infrared sensor (PIR). The camera will capture image if there is an input from PIR sensor. Images that are captured by the camera will be processed by a controller for pest detection. The pest detector controller uses a machine learning algorithm to track the presence of pests. Then, a buzzer (connected to the controller using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol) will sound if the controller successfully detects pests.

Tomatoes are popular in many parts of the world because they are easy to grow and have a high nutritional value. The fact that tomato fruits are prone to disease, even when grown in greenhouses, is a major challenge in large-scale tomato production. Agricultural drones are now being used to construct precision farming systems that can automatically detect irregularities in tomatoes. The main challenge with using a drone in a greenhouse is that the drone must be tiny enough to carry a restricted load, including an onboard computer. Because of this, the algorithm used to detect tomato fruit anomalies must be compact and efficient. The tomato fruit abnormalities detecting method was proposed in this research. The method involved with CNNs and image processing algorithms. First the location of each tomato in tomato vines were identify and localized by using YOLOv4-tiny CNNs model, then, each tomato fruit was cropped. The background of the tomato fruit was removed by graph-like structure called GrabCut. Finally, all major defects were detected separately by the segmentation-based color thresholding technique. The experiments were conducted. The result showed that YOLOv4-tiny could detect tomato fruits with 98.68% AP and the color thresholding successfully detected the tomato anomalies.;;978-1-6654-7353-8;10.1109/ICA-SYMP56348.2023.10044938;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044938;"Artificial Intelligent;CNNs;YOLOv4-tiny;Image Processing;Plant Anomalies;Agriculture";"Image segmentation;Thresholding (Imaging);Image color analysis;Instruments;Process control;Greenhouses;Production";"agricultural products;agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;diseases;food products;image colour analysis;image processing;image segmentation;object detection;plant diseases";"greenhouse drone application;large-scale tomato production;tomato anomalies;tomato fruit abnormalities;tomato fruit anomalies detector;tomato vines";;;;13;IEEE;22.2.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

In classic computer vision benchmark tests, new algorithms keep appearing that outperform each other. However, these benchmark tests cannot be generalized, so that the specific application must be considered for the selection of sensors and algorithms. Especially in the agricultural domain, environmental conditions like weather and vegetation significantly influence the reliability of sensor systems. Therefore, it is essential to test different sensor modalities and algorithms in the operational design domain. This motivates the need for an evaluation framework which has the flexibility to compare and validate various perception algorithms, sensors suites, and data samples with a focus on different conditions. This paper proposes a pipeline combining a test environment (AI-TEST-FIELD), a semantic environment representation (SEEREP), and an inference server (Triton) for an automatic evaluation of different CNN-based perception algorithms under various environment conditions. Recurring and comparable recordings of raw sensor data with identical scenarios and objects can be performed on the test field, with the only difference being the environmental conditions. The inference results are inferred once and stored alongside the sensor data in SEEREP. Thus, they can be queried efficiently based on the environment conditions to generate (partially overlapping) subsets of the whole dataset. It is demonstrated how this pipeline can be used to apply the CNN-inference just once on the data, and how the queried subsets can subsequently be used to evaluate the performance in different environment conditions.;2767-8733;979-8-3503-0704-7;10.1109/ECMR59166.2023.10256352;"Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture(grant numbers:28-D-K1.01A-20); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10256352;;"Analytical models;Pipelines;Semantics;Robot sensing systems;Data models;Inference algorithms;Sensor systems";"agriculture;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);inference mechanisms;mobile robots;query processing;robot vision";"agricultural domain;AI-TEST-FIELD;automatic evaluation;autonomous mobile robots;classic computer vision benchmark tests;CNN-inference;data samples;deep learning;different CNN-based perception algorithms;different environment conditions;different sensor modalities;environmental conditions;evaluation framework;operational design domain;perception applications;raw sensor data;robotic sensor data;scalable evaluation pipeline;semantic environment representation;sensor systems;sensors suites;test environment;test field";;;;40;IEEE;27.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Traditional disease detection methods rely on extracting manual features from acquired images to identify infection types. Furthermore, the performance of these works is entirely dependent on the nature of the selected manual features. This can be solved by automatically learning features through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This paper presents a convolutional neural network called ToNet that uses two different dimensionality reduction structures for detecting infection types on tomato leaves. Experiments were carried out using 10 types of tomato leaves from the PlantVillage Dataset. The images were normalized and input into the neural network, and compared with several classic convolutional neural networks. Comparing several different activation functions, it is found that the accuracy of using Mish activation function is the highest. The experimental results show that, the proposed model can achieve a test accuracy of 95.96%.;;978-1-6654-9079-5;10.1109/ICIBA56860.2023.10165158;"Third Military Medical University; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10165158;"tomato leaf identification;convolutional neural network;PlantVillage;activation function";"Insects;Neural networks;Manuals;Parallel processing;Feature extraction;Mobile handsets;Convolutional neural networks";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pest control;plant diseases";"300 million people;agricultural field;challenging research areas;classic convolutional neural networks;convolutional neural network;different activation functions;different dimensionality reduction structures;extracting manual features;infection types;insect pests;multichannel parallelism;selected manual features;severe food insecurity;tomato leaf diseases;tomato leaves;traditional disease detection methods";;;;15;IEEE;6.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the utility of ALS and TLS systems and their combination (ALS+TLS) in predicting CBD in a longleaf pine forest ecosystem in Florida. In the field, tree attributes, such as tree height (HT), crown width (CW), crown base height (CBH) and diameter at breast height (DBH) in three plots of ~ 0.19 ha were measured and CBD (kg/m3) was calculated. Individual trees were detected from ALS, TLS and ALS+TLS, and lidar-derived crown-level metrics were computed for CBD modeling. The results show that CBD can be accurately predicted from ALS, TLS and ALS+TLS. However, the ALS + TLS improved CBD prediction accuracy only slightly. Given that ALS+TLS fusion is less practical and more expensive, our comparison suggests that either ALS or TLS measurements are still reasonable for CBD prediction and their usefulness is justified.;2153-7003;979-8-3503-2010-7;10.1109/IGARSS52108.2023.10282833;"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program; Joint Fire Science Program; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10282833;"Lidar;fuels;crown Metrics;Random Forest;Modeling";"Uncertainty;Laser radar;Ecosystems;Measurement by laser beam;Geoscience and remote sensing;Forestry;Vegetation";;;;;;12;IEEE;20.10.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

In conventional agricultural procedures, the diagnosis of illnesses affecting rice plants is performed by professionals in a manner that is very subjective, while laboratory testing takes a significant amount of time. As a direct result of this, there is a decrease in agricultural productivity, which results in economic loss for farmers. In order to find a solution to this problem, there is a pressing need to create methods that are quick and accurate in identifying and categorizing illnesses that affect rice plants. In the field of agriculture, the development of image-based automated systems for the categorization of rice plant diseases has become an intriguing and expanding study subject.

Large scale multi-crop discrimination using airborne, or satellite remote sensing is required for farm level intervention and for decision making by various stake holders such as agriculture insurance companies, risk assessment agencies and local governments. Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data from various platforms have been used for discriminating and mapping various crops. However, the number of crops, and the scale at which the discrimination is often limited to a few crops and is often approached as discrimination against other land cover classes. Further, multi-temporal datasets and spectral indices form the bulk of the datasets for crops discrimination. For potential operational application at field level, the ability to discriminate numerous crops-at least ten different crops at the same timeframe are vital. Furthermore, discrimination of crops grown under organic practices has promising application in the certification and quality assurance of agricultural produced sold as organic product. Theoretically, high resolution hyperspectral data has the capability to difference few tens of classes unambiguously. However, given the context of systematic spectral similarity in vegetation, especially crops, the potential of discrimination several crops are unclear. We, therefore, has assessed the spectral discrimination of as many as 23 different vegetable crops and attempted discriminating a few vegetable crops grown under organic and inorganic crop growing practices. For this, we have applied 12 different statistical and machine learning algorithms establishing the spectral discrimination and assessing its relative stand across the range of crops considered. The results indicate complex patterns of spectral discrimination wherein a few crops exhibit spectral similarity with several other crops at any scale of spectral characterization. The discrimination analysis of vegetable crops grown under organic and chemical input-based practices indicate a good discrimination. However, the quality of discrimination is substantially affected by the type of machine learning model used.

Seed is the starting point of any kind of cultivation of plants, as they go through multiple stages to become as a plant. The seed are presented to the farmers through government and private agencies for different kinds of plants. There are various types of seeds such as organic, natural and hybrid, which brought by the farmers based on their requirement. Seeds are first tested and checked as a sample by the office of seed certification of the different states governments. The seeds are bought on lots or a certain required quantity by the farmers or public. The testing of the quality of the seeds are generally done through manual process, which is done as samples where there may be few wasted seeds in the packets or the lots purchased. This paper proposes a new quality checking process through machine vision system with deep learning, as the seeds are passed through the cameras and utilizing the image process technique with deep learning algorithms to match the quality which is trained to the system to identify and classify the seeds. Two different algorithms are proposed, U-Net and Fully Convolutional Regression Networks (FCRN) to classify and segregate the seeds. A mobile application has also been proposed and developed to experiment the process, as the application can be directly accessed by the public/farmers. As experimented with the algorithms, the proposed U-Net algorithm has shown better results on non-destructive detection with great potential for seed quality control and seed count.;;979-8-3503-9844-1;10.1109/ACCTHPA57160.2023.10083344;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083344;"Seed Morphometry;Optical Sensing;Seed Texture;Canny Edge Detector;Fully Convolutional Network (FCN);U-Net;Fully Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN)";"Deep learning;Government;Manuals;Quality control;Cameras;Seeds (agriculture);Mobile applications";"agriculture;cameras;computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);government policies;image segmentation;mobile computing;quality control;regression analysis;seeds (agriculture)";"agriculture;cameras;deep-learning;FCRN;fully convolutional regression networks;GDP;government agencies;image process technique;India;machine vision system;mobile application;private agencies;seed certification;seed counting analysis;seed quality control;U-net algorithm";;;;20;IEEE;3.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

With the development of deep learning, neural network-based image segmentation has not only improved significantly in terms of accuracy but can also be fully automated end-to-end. The research in this paper is based on leaves in the plant domain and focuses on segmentation techniques to segment different leaves from images in the plant body, providing the basis for leaf recognition and plant growth state analysis. However, the existing methods are not capable of extracting multi-scale features and converge slowly, resulting in limited segmentation results. Based on this, a new algorithmic model is proposed in this paper. Based on the traditional Unet model, we introduce a residual network as encoder to further enhance the extraction of deep-seated features from images. To improve the generalisation ability of the model, our model uses the idea of multi-task learning with image-based mask reconstruction to enhance the prior knowledge of images for inductive migration.

As the supplier of human energy, crops are seen as being significant. Plant diseases can harm leaves at any point during planting and harvest, greatly reducing crop productivity and the general market’s financial worth. Consequently, the early diagnosis of leaf disease is crucial in farmlands. Agriculture profitability is a key factor in economic growth. This is among the causes why plant disease identification is crucial in the farming sector, as the presence of illness in plants is extremely common. If necessary precautions aren’t followed in these regions, plants suffer major consequences, which impact the grade, volume, or production of the corresponding products. For example, the United States has pine trees that are susceptible to a dangerous illness called small-leaf disease and the backbone of the Indian economy is crop plants. It is advantageous to diagnose plant diseases (Black Spot, other leaf spots, powdery mildew, downy mildew, blight, and canker) using an automated method since it lessens the amount of manpower required to maintain megafarms of crops and does so at an incredibly preliminary phase(when they appear on plant leaves). The computerized identification and classification of plant leaf diseases using an imagery segmented system is presented in this work. It also includes an overview of various disease categorization methods that can be applied to the identification of plant leaf diseases. In order to detect disorders in diverse plant leaves, this study provides a review of diverse plant diseases and several classifying algorithms in deep machine learning.;2473-7577;979-8-3503-4821-7;10.1109/ICCCI56745.2023.10128246;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128246;"Plant disease;Leaf disease;Plant leaf disease detection;Plant leaf disease classification;Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Deep machine learning (DML)";"Fungi;Productivity;Plant diseases;Machine learning algorithms;Profitability;Neural networks;Crops";"agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);plant diseases";"agriculture profitability;crop plants;crop productivity;deep machine learning;deep neural networks;disease categorization methods;diverse plant diseases;diverse plant leaves;general market;infect agricultural crops;leaf spots;multicrop leaf disease detection;multiplant;plant disease identification;plant leaf diseases;planting;precision agriculture;small-leaf disease";;1;;33;IEEE;24.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The suggested approach makes use of a dataset of photographs of both healthy and ill wheat plants that has been resized, normalized, and enhanced. On this dataset, which contains 10 types of wheat illnesses, including powdery mildew, yellow rust, and leaf rust, among others, we refine the pre-trained VGG19 model. We assess the suggested model's performance using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The findings demonstrate that the suggested model beats various cutting-edge wheat disease detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 97.65% on the validation dataset. The suggested technique can be implemented in practical applications to give farmers a dependable and effective way to identify wheat illnesses.

Often model ensembling is adopted to increase the overall detection accuracy. However, this can result in a large system that may face deployment issues in a resource-constrained environment. Subsequently, strongly labeled data was found to improve the audio classification performance in sound-related domains; this may indicate that such data may be required for SED model development. However, such data will inevitably contain a certain level of noise. In order to reduce the number of parameters, we proposed a lightweight system that utilized an improved depthwise separable convolution and an improved conformer layer. This lightweight system is then trained using an extension of the binary cross-entropy loss which considers the reverse binary cross-entropy to combat the noise that may be present in the training data. Based on the proposed framework, our lightweight system can obtain an event-based F1-score of 52%, and the ensemble of four systems through posterior averaging can further improve the event-based F1-score to 53.5%.

To address this issue, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often used in agriculture to identify the unique features of weeds and classify them based on low-resolution imaging, which helps to control weed populations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Deep Learning (DL) models have advanced, achieving remarkable performances in plant-weed classification. Despite Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) success in computer vision, they still need help with massive labeled datasets, intra-class classification, and high processing costs when used in classification tasks. Meanwhile, transformer-based models have shown significant modeling capabilities globally but are yet to be thoroughly investigated in agriculture. In this study, we explore Self-Attention Vision Transformers (ViT) using a Transfer Learning (TL) approach to classify weeds in benchmark datasets.

A prerequisite for such systems is a robust plant classification system that can identify crops and weeds in various agricultural fields. Most vision-based systems train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a given dataset, i.e., the source domain, to perform semantic segmentation of images. However, deploying these models on unseen fields, i.e., in the target domain, often shows a low generalization capability. Enhancing the generalization capability of CNNs is critical to increasing their performance on target domains with different operational conditions. In this letter, we present a domain generalized semantic segmentation approach for robust crop and weed detection by effectively extending and diversifying the source domain to achieve high performance across different agricultural field conditions. We propose to leverage unlabeled images captured from various agricultural fields during training in a two-step framework. First, we suggest a method to automatically compute sparse annotations and use them to present the model more plant varieties and growth stages to enhance its generalization capability. Among others, we exploit unlabeled images from fields containing crops sown in rows. Second, we propose a style transfer method that renders the source domain images in the style of images from various fields to achieve increased diversification.

This primary sector mainly suffers the adversities due to types and level of nutrition in the soil, weather conditions, and various other factors. The datasets available for crop yield according to the state, daily weather predictions, and annual rainfall could help better the agricultural output. Declassification of datasets has led to the absence of knowledge, and perhaps, could not solve the problem of improving crop yield. Thus, as a solution, choosing suitable crops in alignment with the weather will result in harvesting at the right time. The objective is to collaborate technology with agriculture, to solve the problem or issue of lesser crop yield due to lesser availability of knowledge regarding rainfall and agriculture. Predicting the rainfall conditions through a regression model for crops according to their states and the respective rainfall data will solve the irrigation-related issues. The proposed regression model examines extensively available data to predict the quarterly rainfall which the farmers can then use to get better agricultural output.;;978-1-6654-6216-7;10.1109/ICAIS56108.2023.10073904;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10073904;"Agriculture;Rainfall;Agrotech;Artificial Intelligence;Linear Regression";"Machine learning algorithms;Linear regression;Crops;Weather forecasting;Machine learning;Predictive models;Soil";"agriculture;crops;irrigation;rain;regression analysis;soil";"adversities;aggrotech;agricultural output;agriculture;annual rainfall;daily weather predictions;employment;GDP;irrigation-related issues;lesser crop yield;primary sector;quarterly rainfall;rainfall conditions;regression model examines;respective rainfall data;suitable crops;weather conditions;weather prediction model";;1;;37;IEEE;27.3.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

When crop yields drop, food prices rise, and people who can't afford even potatoes go hungry. Physical examination is a component of conventional approaches for spotting diseases in plants. This approach is exceedingly costly, laborious, and doesn't yield good outcomes. A unique approach for diagnosing potato leaf ailments should be developed to detect sick leaves at the start of their developmental period, which will assist to boost the output and consequently reduce the financial losses suffered by agriculturalists. Fortunately, new Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) models have flourished as a method of reducing plant disease and increasing crop yields, alleviating some of the burdens on farmers. Deep Neural Networks (DNN), a kind of artificial intelligence technology, may be used to identify disease-infected plants so that they can be treated early on, in the bud stage, before the sickness has spread too far. Based on a comprehensive literature assessment, the authors of this research concluded that Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are superior to other methods for detecting leaf diseases and it is determined that CNN provides the highest achievable accuracy of 91% to 100%.;;979-8-3503-0088-8;10.1109/ICOSEC58147.2023.10276029;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10276029;"Agricultural Workers;Comprehensive Analysis Convolution Neural Network;Crop Yields;Deep Neural Network;Potato Leaf Diseases";"Deep learning;Productivity;Plant diseases;Microorganisms;Convolution;Biological system modeling;Transfer learning";"agriculture;artificial intelligence;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);plant diseases";"agricultural country;artificial intelligence technology;Convolution Neural Networks;crop production rate;crop yields drop;deep learning;Deep Neural Networks;developmental period;diagnosing potato leaf ailments;disease-infected plants;financial losses;food prices;good outcomes;increasing crop yields;India;leaf diseases;machine learning;physical examination;plant disease;potato leaves;potatoes;sick leaves";;;;17;IEEE;16.10.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

In reality, it is unavoidable that the dataset has a large gap in the number of positive and negative instances across different categories in source and target domains, which is the imbalanced domain adaptation problem. However, since the imbalanced degree always varies greatly in different source- and target-domain datasets, most of the existing imbalanced domain adaptation models fix the imbalanced parameters, which cannot adapt to the change of the proportion between positive and negative instances in different domains. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a self-adaptive imbalanced domain adaptation method via a deep sparse autoencoder, which can adjust the model automatically according to the imbalanced extent for bridging the chasm of domains. More specifically, the self-adaptive imbalanced cross-entropy loss is designed for emphasizing more on minority categories and compensating the bias of training loss automatically. In addition, to alleviate the deficient problem of labeled data, we further propose the unlabeled information incorporating method by minimizing the distribution discrepancy of high-level representation space between the source and target domains.

The robot arm movement control is important in the use of robot arms. This paper presents model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) in robot arm movement control in case studies where targets are in random positions. The numerical studies of 2 and 3-DOF robots moving in planar motion are used as test problems. In 2-DOF robot control, 2 tasks - placing and reaching are employed. In 3-DOF robot control, noise is considered. Machine learning regression techniques - Gaussian process regression (GPR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR) - are used in environment modelling in MBRL while particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used as optimization tool in MBRL. The numerical studies show that MBRL with GPR has the highest performance with at least 95% success rate while MBRL with the other regression techniques such as ANN and SVR can succeed only 23-93% and 31-47%, respectively. Therefore, MBRL with GPR and PSO is suitable for robot arm movement control.;;978-1-6654-7353-8;10.1109/ICA-SYMP56348.2023.10044940;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044940;"robot arm control;model-based reinforcement;machine learning;regression;particle swarm optimization";"Service robots;3-DOF;Robot control;Artificial neural networks;Reinforcement learning;Manipulators;Numerical models";"control engineering computing;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;regression analysis;reinforcement learning;support vector machines";"MBRL;model-based reinforcement learning;particle swarm optimization;regression techniques;robot arm movement control;robot arms;robot control";;;;10;IEEE;22.2.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Worldwide, agricultural research has bolstered profit optimization and is a significant and large field to acquire more advantages. There are innumerable people who own land today, but they have no idea how to produce food. Everyone can only succeed in the future through agriculture. Most people practice unproductive agriculture because they grow crops on subpar soil. India's farmers frequently select crops that are not suitable for their soils, which reduces production. By providing the proper crops, precision agriculture has addressed this issue for farmers. Based on the state of the soil. In India, which is regarded as an agricultural nation, there are various ways to offer advice. The advice given today is based on communications amongst farmers and draws on knowledge from a number of sources. Precision farming is a cutting-edge farming method that offers the best crop to farmers based on site-specific criteria after collecting and analyzing data on soil properties, soil types, and crop production. By doing this, the likelihood of picking the incorrect crop is decreased, and productivity is raised. This structure is said to be able to forecast the ideal crop for the agronomist's region. Additionally, recommendations are offered for a variety of farming techniques and tactics, such as crop diversity, crop spacing, irrigation, sow processing, etc. as well as advice on pesticides and fertilizers. They are founded on previous soil indices. cost projections for crops and the weather. You will be able to determine the sorts of soil, the water source on that property, and what crop you should grow with this application. Additionally, you will be able to recommend which crops will thrive in that soil. Therefore, the application offers details about those who work in agriculture. For instance, we can identify the crop that will grow best given the soil, the climate, the temperature, etc. As a result, machine learning is used to determine the crop for each soil. Farmers can receive advice on what crop to plant and what fertilizer to use based on historical data from agricultural operations. Based on your previous agricultural actions, this tool can also be used to boost crop yields and suggest that you plant particular crops.;2575-7288;979-8-3503-9737-6;10.1109/ICACCS57279.2023.10113081;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113081;"Agriculture;Machine Learning;Farming;Crop suggestion;k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN);Crop Recommendation";"Analytical models;Machine learning algorithms;Plants (biology);Crops;Soil;Classification algorithms;Random forests";"agricultural engineering;agriculture;crops;farming;fertilisers;irrigation;learning (artificial intelligence);pesticides;productivity;profitability;soil";"agriculture;crop diversity;crop production;crop recommendation;crop spacing;crop yields;farmers;ideal crop;incorrect crop;plant particular crops;proper crops";;1;;10;IEEE;5.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

However, in the field of smart agriculture, there are common problems, such as difficulty in obtaining high-quality disease samples and high cost. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a high-quality image augmentation (HQIA) method for generating high-quality rice leaf disease images based on a dual generative adversarial network (GAN). First, the original samples were used to train Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP) to generate pseudo-data samples. The pseudo-data samples were put into the Optimized-Real-ESRGAN (Opt-Real-ESRGAN) to generate high-quality pseudo-data samples. Finally, the high-quality pseudo-data samples were put into the disease classification convolutional neural network, and the effectiveness of the method was verified by indicators. Experimental results showed that this method can generate high-quality rice leaf disease images, and the recognition accuracy of high-quality rice disease image samples augmented by this method was 4.57% higher than that of using only the original training set on ResNet18 and 4.1% higher on VGG11. Compared with the data augmentation method only by WGAN-GP, the accuracy of ResNet18 increased by 3.08%, and the accuracy of VGG11 increased by 3.55%.

The research area is located in Northeast China, including Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, Liaoning Province, and the four eastern alliance cities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Hulunbuir City, Tongliao City, Chifeng City, Xing’an League). In the study area, the maize production is mainly based on rain-fed agriculture. By analyzing the number of days, accumulated temperature greater than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius, precipitation (mm), and sunshine hours (h) during every two consecutive phenological period to unveil the meteorological conditions for maize phenology, development, and yield formation in the study area.The research results show that most areas in Northeast China have relatively abundant thermal resources, with accumulated temperature greater than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius(AT10) exceeding 2700 °C • d, making them suitable for planting mid to late maturing varieties. However, the thermal conditions in the northern part of Heilongjiang are relatively poor, increasing the probability of suffering from cold damage. During the growth period of maize, sufficient water supply is an important guarantee for its normal growth and development, achieving high and stable yields. However, the precipitation in the western part of the research area cannot meet the needs of maize growth and yield formation, and the area experiences perennial drought. By analyzing the number of days between different phenology, including the average number of days for maize sowing date to emergence, emergence to 3-leaf, 3-leaf to 7-leaf, 7-leaf to tasseling, tasseling to silking, silking to milk stage, and milk stage to maturity observed by meteorological stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and the four eastern alliance cities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it is evident that the interannual variation of the main growth period of maize varies significantly. For example, in the northern region with poor thermal conditions, sowing date trends earlier at most stations, whereas in the southern region with better thermal conditions, such trends are not significant.The findings have important theoretical significance and application value for guiding agricultural production, disaster prevention and reduction, and ensuring high and stable yields of maize.;;979-8-3503-0351-3;10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics59224.2023.10233611;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10233611;"maize;meteorological conditions;growth period of maize;temperature;precipitation";"Precipitation;Dairy products;Urban areas;Droughts;Crops;Market research;Agriculture";"agriculture;crops;meteorology;phenology;rain;sunlight;water supply";"accumulated temperature;agricultural production;Chifeng City;eastern alliance cities;food crop;Heilongjiang Province;Hulunbuir City;Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region;Jilin Province;Liaoning Province;maize growth;maize main growth period;maize phenology;maize production;maize sowing date;maize yield formation;meteorological conditions;meteorological stations;milk stage;Northeast China;perennial drought;phenological period;precipitation;rain-fed agriculture;spring maize;sunshine hours;thermal resources;Tongliao City;water supply;Xingan League";;;;8;IEEE;1.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

As for the production of organic fertilizers for the cultivation of land, domestic animals like cows, goats, bulls, and chickens are most useful in farming. Organic farming uses cow and bull dung as a fertilizer for maintaining the soil structure and renewing the soil with the proper nutrients that help the proper growth of plants. Around the world, 1.3 billion farmers depend on livestock. According to the Indian government, 20 million people depend on domestic animal farming, and 600 million poor farmers are dependent on livestock for alternative income and the production of raw materials used in agriculture and industry. Domestic farm animals face many problems in their shed, including health-related problems, wild animal attacks, drinking water issues, improper condition of the shed, and many more problems. Various diseases have been transmitted to domestic animals, including fever, mouth and sore infection, brucellosis, and, more recently, lumpy skin diseases. All these diseases are spread by small insects like mosquitoes, flies, ticks, and snakes. The main objective of this paper is to create an environment for domestic animals' betterment and relaxation in their shed, to measure the environment's temperature of the animals shed, and to maintain the temperature. Also, measure the water level of the animal shed, check how many animals enter it, count all those animals, and send the data to the farmer. Also, detect the hazardous animal entering the shed.

The agricultural methods used and the commodities produced can vary between different locations. The challenge for farmers is make to right choice of the crop in light of the current weather and soil nutrient levels. The project’s primary goal is to develop a reliable model that provides precise predictions of crop sustainability for a specific soil type and set of weather circumstances. In an attempt to eliminate loss for the farmers, the model provides a model that recommends the best local crop. The following factors are taken into account when building the model: nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, temperature, air humidity, soil pH, and annual rainfall. Considering the data gathered from previous years, the model assists in choosing the type of crop that must be grown. The model is trained using an ensemble learning strategy that incorporates Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which has acquired an accuracy of 99.31 for the model.

Using visually apparent patterns on the plant, numerous studies on plant illnesses have been extensively investigated to discover abnormalities in plant growth. A sustainable agriculture depends on plant monitoring and disease detection. However, because they demand precise and real-time diagnosis, monitoring plant diseases manually is highly challenging. Plant disease diagnosis frequently uses image processing, which includes picture acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In this paper, an efficient plant disease classification using SVM Classifier is proposed. Firstly, the adaptive histogram technique is applied to the image and the required part is segmented using Otsu’s segmentation. The segmented output is applied to SVM to classify between the normal and diseased images. Further, the soft thresholding is applied to improve the accuracy. The proposed method is tested for standard database to obtain 95% accuracy compared to existing techniques.;;979-8-3503-2379-5;10.1109/ICAISC58445.2023.10201001;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10201001;"Plant Disease classification;Artificial Intelligence;Support Vector Machine (SVM);Image processing algorithm;Soft thresholding;Cucumber Mosaic.";"Support vector machines;Plant diseases;Image segmentation;Histograms;Thresholding (Imaging);Plants (biology);Support vector machine classification";"agricultural products;agriculture;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;plant diseases;support vector machines";"adaptive histogram technique;agricultural product;disease detection;diseased images;feature extraction;image processing;normal images;Otsu's segmentation;picture acquisition;plant disease diagnosis;plant diseases monitoring;plant growth;plant illnesses;plant leaf disease classification;post processing techniques;real-time diagnosis;segmented output;sustainable agriculture;SVM classifier;visually apparent patterns;yield loss";;;;16;IEEE;9.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Deep learning models trained with proper loss functions are widely used in crop mapping and have achieved promising results. However, most of the existing loss functions focus on loss optimization in a universal way, i.e., problems regarding sample imbalance, and neglect the uniqueness of crop mapping task, for which its target often shows phenological characteristics. Given this, this letter proposes a crop phenological prior cross entropy loss (PPCE) function, which focuses on guiding the training processing in the direction where crops can be better identified. It is practical and easy to use. The phenological prior is quantified using normalized difference yellow index and normalized difference vegetation index obtained in different growing periods. Under the supervision of PPCE, if a crop pixel is misclassified to other class, the prior knowledge will increase the contribution of its loss to the final loss and thus guide the network to extract more discriminative features for crop mapping. To demonstrate the performance of PPCE, five widely used loss functions combined with three typical deep learning models (LSTM, DNN, and 1D-CNN) are compared. Experimental results show better performance of PPCE than the existing loss functions with different deep learning models.;1558-0571;;10.1109/LGRS.2022.3230421;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801227,42101340); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991949;"Crop mapping;crop phenology;deep learning;loss function;remote sensing";"Crops;Indexes;Time series analysis;Deep learning;Vegetation mapping;Training;Remote sensing";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);entropy;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;remote sensing;vegetation;vegetation mapping";"crop mapping task;crop phenological prior cross entropy loss function;crop pixel;crops;different deep learning models;existing loss functions;final loss;loss optimization;normalized difference vegetation index;normalized difference yellow index;phenological characteristics;PPCE;practical loss;proper loss functions;remote sensing technology;timely crop mapping;typical deep learning models";;;;24;IEEE;19.12.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

However, existing single-sequence learning frameworks are difficult to accurately and adequately capture contextual information, leaving a large proportion of outliers between two low-overlap scenes. In this article, we present a progressive guidance network (PG-Net) to gather rich contextual information and exclude outliers. Specifically, we design a novel iterative structure that exploits the inlier probabilities of correspondences to guide the classification of initial correspondences progressively. This structure can mitigate outlier effects with robust contextual information to obtain more accurate model estimation. In addition, to sufficiently capture contextual information, we propose a grouped dense fusion attention (GDFA) feature embedding module to enhance the representation of inliers and significant channel–spatial. Meanwhile, we propose a two-stage neural spectral matching (TSNSM) module to compute the inlier probability of each correspondence and estimate a 3-D transformation model in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments results on the indoor and outdoor datasets using distinct 3-D local descriptors demonstrate that our PG-Net surpasses state-of-the-art outlier removal methods. Especially compared with the recent outlier removal network PointDSC, our PG-Net improves the registration recall by 4.06% on the indoor dataset with the FPFH descriptor.

Due to the potential of its compounds, cannabis has become an economically viable plant. Many growers in Thailand are turning to cannabis as one of the yield crops and probably an alternative economically crop. The growers generally buy regular seeds for planting outdoor, resulting in the mix of growing up to male and female plants. The fact that only female cannabis plants are preferred as they provide valuable cannabinoid-rich flowers to harvest. Therefore, automated screening the gender of cannabis seeds upfront prior to plant could help lower waste and increase profitability. Agri-technology such as computer vision has played an important role in agriculture. Object detection models would facilitate sorting out female from male seeds. However, dataset annotation is resource consumption. This paper thus presents an approach of semi-automated image annotation as part of the YOLOv5 object detection model for gender screening of cannabis seeds. The preliminary result is promising.

Weeds are unwanted plants that compete with crops for resources, and act as pests to crops, resulting in reduced crop yield quality and increased cultivation and labor cost. So, effective site-specific weed detection and removal is necessary for efficient and cost-effective agriculture. Recent studies have focused on developing automated weed detection systems using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Most studies have focused on weed classification, with less attention given to identifying numerous weeds in a single image. The paper aims to comprehensively review and compare various weed detection techniques, focusing on soybean crops, as an image classification and object detection task. After examining the strengths and limitations of each approach, the study concludes that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based and Transformer-based deep learning models achieved the best possible accuracy possible.

The awareness of the location of fields on the farms is of great importance to a farmer. Even though this can be done for small farm holders by manually surveying the field but it is a very human resource-intensive and time-consuming task for huge farms. Knowing the partition of the fields by their serial number or name can significantly improve the management of fields especially when it is reaping season. Also, the boundary shapefiles can be integrated with a precision farming platform through which farmers can keep a track of all the activities taking place in all their fields, which was not possible before.

Also, when the paradigm shift is towards smart agriculture these years, automation of every aspect of crop growing and monitoring is important. Therefore, in this work, we have analyzed the appropriateness of an automated approach for the classification of diseases in plants.

Many IoT devices can be deployed for precision farming, soil management, automated irritation, information gathering, or performing some local processing to provide various services. Due to the computational capacity limitation of IoT devices and their limited power, UAV-aided mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed to provide IoT nodes with additional resources by hosting their computation functions and making smart agriculture use cases more operational. On the other hand, from the implementation viewpoint, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging approach recently proposed for flexible management of such computation functions in UAVs and MEC-server. However, efficient orchestration of the virtualized functions is a challenge. In this paper, we consider a decentralized UAV-aided MEC system in which the NFV-enabled processing nodes manage the computational tasks. To be more specific, we consider the smart agriculture use cases that need live streaming/analysis, such as surveillance or environmental monitoring. In such a network, we propose a method for orchestrating the NFVs efficiently, while the network energy consumption throughout the network is minimized. This problem becomes even more crucial when considering a strict condition on the instantaneous AoI values. Therefore, the problem is first formulated as a Decentralized Constrained Multi-agent Markov Decision Process (Dec-CMMDP). As the formulated problem is NEXP, in the next step, we exploit some structural features of the considered network and introduce the concept of symmetry to simplify the problem. Then, inspired by Augmented Lagrangian dual optimization, a novel decentralized, federated learning-based solution is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption, minimizing the average AoI, and satisfying the strict condition of AoI  $ < 100$  msec for supporting real-time applications in our network parameter settings.;2831-316X;;10.1109/TMLCN.2023.3311749;"MITACS Canada; Nokia Bell Labs; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10238738;"Internet of Things;network function virtualization;age of information;UAV-aided mobile edge computing (UAV-aided MEC);constraint MDP;federated reinforcement learning";"Internet of Things;Smart agriculture;Monitoring;Task analysis;Farming;Servers;Real-time systems";"agriculture;autonomous aerial vehicles;edge computing;energy consumption;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;multi-agent systems;network function virtualisation";"AoI-limited SFC;Augmented Lagrangian dual optimization;Dec-CMMDP;decentralized constrained multiagent Markov decision process;decentralized UAV-aided MEC system;federated learning;Internet of Things;IoT devices;IoT nodes;MEC-server;network energy consumption;network function virtualization;network parameter settings;NFV-enabled processing node;precision farming;smart agriculture;soil management;UAV-aided mobile-edge computing";;;;60;CCBY;4.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

This study develops a novel technique for mechanically classifying diseases in rice plants by utilizing image processing techniques. To achieve accurate feature extraction, this study suggests a K-means clustering for segmenting the diseased section from a leaf image and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to extract different characteristics for multi-class classification under the three categories of colour, shape, and texture. The proposed system detects leaves and probably disease-induced lesions using image processing algorithms. With a test accuracy of 100%, the XceptionNet deep feature with SVM classifier outperforms the other existing models that have undergone DMD preprocessing.

Nowadays, the detection of diseases through images using machine learning and deep learning has achieved state-of-art results. Yet these models suffer from two shortcomings, one is the data-hungry models of deep learning, and the second is the adaption of new classes with previous ones, i.e., if a new disease arrived, one must retrain the entire model with a new dataset which has led to the origination of few-shot learning that solves both problems. A wheat disease classification network is proposed based on a few-shot learning method for the classification of 18 wheat diseases using EfficientNet as a backbone. Also, the attention mechanism is incorporated to facilitate efficient feature selection. Our proposed network has achieved 93.19% accuracy on the 40 images of 18 disease classes manually collected from the internet while that of our backbone network EfficientNet has gained an accuracy of about 98.5% accuracy on CGIAR Dataset. The evaluation demonstrates that despite the presence of only a few images in both the training and query sets, the proposed model has achieved superior performance in terms of accuracy and computation cost.

Due to illiteracy and poor knowledge of botany and plants farmers used to suffer terrific amount of economic losses. The traditional methods used by farmers were not up to the mark. In earlier times the farmers used to detect if the plant is healthy, or it has some sort of disease. This method is obviously not very productive and also, very cumbersome. So with the help of new technology, we can detect the problem very easily within fraction of seconds and it also provide very optimized results. We have a dataset called Plant village which has more than 2000 images of different leaves.

To overcome these challenges, we developed a multi-task deep learning-based method that generalizes well to unseen data sets. The potential of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated on temporal high resolution (5.8m) IRS P-6 LISS IV images.

It is crucial to India’s GDP and economy. Yet getting here wasn’t a simple journey. Fast degradation of resources a number of causes, including population growth, climate change, diseases, labour shortages, and others, have periodically severely affected the food supply. The role of seed recommendation in agriculture is to provide farmers with the optimal seed variety based on a range of environmental criteria, including soil type, weather, and other relevant factors. Decision trees and XGBoost are two popular machine learning techniques that may be used for this purpose. Farmers may now prevent any costly accidents as a consequence of how machine learning and data analytics have transformed it. Our Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), which consists of a field-deployed PIC microcontroller (IC PIC16F877A), Node MCU (ESP82666), USB to UART converter, driver, relay, water pump, soil moisture, pH, NPK, temperature, and humidity sensors, shows to be a miracle worker. Using machine learning techniques, this IoT can identify the accurate seed, anticipate the crop varieties to be sown based on the appropriateness of the region, and use data to track soil quality. The remote eyes and hands for our farmer are provided by the mobile application myDevices Cayenne and a PC local host database.

With the advent of new technologies in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and others, there is a glimpse of hope for inventing new techniques in farming that will eventually reduce the cost of farming large areas of land. In this paper, a method is proposed that can automatically classify plant seedlings with great accuracy thus making it possible for automatic farming processes. We propose a Deep CNN architecture for the automatic classification of plant seedlings using whole images and using segmented images as input. The test accuracies on a dataset of 4722 images of 12 different species outperform similar methods reported in previous studies. The experiments showed that the proposed method achieved an average test accuracy of 91.58% when whole images are used as input and an average accuracy of 95.02% when segmented images are used as input to the proposed Deep CNN architecture. The segmented images increased the accuracy by 3.44%.;2154-4360;979-8-3503-9622-5;10.1109/ICCAE56788.2023.10111357;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10111357;"leaf segmentation;IoT in plantation;Convolutional neural network;leaf classification;plant seedling;seed planting automation";"Image segmentation;Costs;Automation;Data preprocessing;Globalization;Computer architecture;Manuals";"agriculture;artificial intelligence;cloud computing;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);farming;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;Internet of Things;plant diseases";"12 different species;Artificial Intelligence;automatic classification;automatic farming processes;average test accuracy;burden farmers;cloud computing;Deep CNN architecture;developing developed countries;global markets;great accuracy;increased costs;local markets;organic produce;plant seedlings;preprocessed Deep;regional, markets;test accuracies;using segmented images";;;;23;IEEE;3.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Monitoring plants and measuring their traits is an important task in agriculture often referred to as plant phenotyping. Traditionally, this task is done manually, which is time- and labor-intensive. Robots can automate phenotyping providing reproducible and high-frequency measurements. Today's perception systems use deep learning to interpret these measurements, but require a substantial amount of annotated data to work well. Obtaining such labels is challenging as it often requires background knowledge on the side of the labelers. This letter addresses the problem of reducing the labeling effort required to perform leaf instance segmentation on 3D point clouds, which is a first step toward phenotyping in 3D. Separating all leaves allows us to count them and compute relevant traits as their areas, lengths, and widths. We propose a novel self-supervised task-specific pre-training approach to initialize the backbone of a network for leaf instance segmentation. We also introduce a novel automatic postprocessing that considers the difficulty of correctly segmenting the points close to the stem, where all the leaves petiole overlap. The experiments presented in this letter suggest that our approach boosts the performance over all the investigated scenarios. We also evaluate the embeddings to assess the quality of the fully unsupervised approach and see a higher performance of our domain-specific postprocessing.;2377-3766;;10.1109/LRA.2023.3320018;"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Germany's Excellence Strategy(grant numbers:EXC-2070,390732324); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265122;"Agricultural automation;robotics and automation in agriculture and forestry;semantic scene understanding";"Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Point cloud compression;Image segmentation;Labeling;Plants (biology);Pipelines";"agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);supervised learning;unsupervised learning";"3D point clouds;high-frequency measurements;key natural resources;labelers;labeling effort;leaf instance segmentation;monitoring plants;novel self-supervised task-specific pre-training approach;plant phenotyping;relevant traits;unsupervised pre-training";;;;48;IEEE;27.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Therefore, the diagnosis of plant diseases is a significant concern. Plant disease diagnosis through plant monitoring is necessary for maintainable agriculture. Observing plant diseases automatically is very challenging. Managing plant diseases requires a lot of effort and expertise. Traditionally, identifying plant foliar disease is subjective, inefficient, and expensive, requiring a large number of personnel and a large amount of information about plant disease. This novel uses a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach for plant disease identification to tackle this problem. First, collect the dataset from online Kaggle and pre-process images to remove noise in the first phase. Then Logistic Decision Regression (LDR) method was utilized for feature selection in the pre-processed plant image. After that, we apply segmentation based on selected features. Finally, our proposed method proficiently classifies the plant's disease based on segment images. Therefore, this approach produces high disease detection accuracy and specificity with a minimum error rate compared to different methods.;;979-8-3503-9846-5;10.1109/ICICACS57338.2023.10099559;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099559;"Plant disease;segmentation;feature selection;pre-processing;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)";"Plant diseases;Image segmentation;Error analysis;Plants (biology);Neural networks;Feature extraction;Agriculture";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;feature selection;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);plant diseases;regression analysis";"Convolutional neural network method;deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network approach;effective plant disease prediction;high disease detection accuracy;plant disease diagnosis;plant disease identification;plant foliar disease;plant monitoring;pre-processed plant image";;;;20;IEEE;19.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

PEDS-AI: A Novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Based Artificial Intelligence Powered Visual-Acoustic Pest Early Detection and Identification System for Field Deployment and Surveillance;R. R. Zhang;The Harker School, San Jose, CA, United States;2023 IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability (SusTech);23.5.2023;2023;;;12;19;Currently, there is an urgent need to develop a system for practical in-field pest early detection to combat grasshopper invasions of farmland. This research proposes the first novel visual-acoustic system created to expand the sensorial range for more field flexibility compared to the current unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection. A visual-acoustic database is also designed to support this study. The proposed UAV system is designed and implemented to survey from an optimal 1m altitude and record 48k sampling rate audio to capture the unique visual-acoustic signatures of pests, allowing PEDS-AI to achieve UAV species detection, a problem difficult even for experts. PEDS-AI introduces a dual signal processing algorithm that combines deep learning source separation and spectral gating denoising to cope with the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) caused by the UAV and quiet pests. PEDS-AI then uses segmented photos and scalograms of the cleaned recordings to perform species determination through convolutional neural networks enhanced with transfer learning. The current design can completely cover up to 12,500 $\frac{{{m^2}}}{{hr}}$ for less than 1000 dollars per unit. Improving the Yolov5 model with 46.5 million parameters with a UAV-collected dataset of 100+ infield 48MP photos, visual detection of grasshoppers achieved a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 0.84. In-field recordings from 16 species enhanced the Efficientnetv2 model with 52.9 million parameters, reaching 0.87 precision and 0.90 recall.

Agricultural segmentation targets are generally small in size and heavily obstructed. At the same time, image segmentation in agricultural scenes has strong application scenarios, such as blooming intensity estimation, which refers to the estimation of the density and intensity of blooms, fruit yield estimation, fruit harvesting positioning, and so on. Currently, CNNs dominate semantic segmentation of agricultural scenes due to the significant computational constraints of using the Transformer module. However, CNNs have several disadvantages, such as limited effective receptive fields and the inability to capture global information, which significantly reduce their segmentation accuracy in complex agricultural scenes. In addition, the simple upsampling process used in CNNs can result in blurred segmentation edges and inferior performance. This paper presents a new semantic segmentation algorithm based on SegFormer: PD-SegNet(Powerful Decoder SegFormer Network), which balances accuracy and computational efficiency and combines dynamic kernel self-renewal with edge-aware optimization.

Insect pollination, the natural method, involves insects (e.g., honeybees) vibrating flowers to collect pollen and nectar. This paper proposes an alternate approach, using small drones to search and pollinate flowers in place of bees autonomously. We report field experiments conducted using these drone technologies. The drone must locate flowers ready for pollination. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) image classification system (AI classifier) using machine learning to identify these flowers. Equipped with an AI classifier, the drone searches for flowers through autonomous flight and positioning technology. Upon identifying a suitable flower during its search, the drone makes contact to pollinate it. Integrating AI-based flower detection, autonomous flight control for flower search, and a pollination control device allows the drone to perform pollination.

Missing data can be a significant issue in these spatiotemporal databases, as it can reduce the accuracy of downstream data analysis, inferencing and control algorithms. Data imputation or the estimation of missing data can help fill these gaps by utilizing inherent spatial relationships and temporal patterns. However, existing approaches for estimating this missing information do not effectively capture all dimensions of the spatiotemporal data structure, resulting in erroneous predictions and poor performance. In this paper, we introduce a general framework that leverages a spatiotemporal graph constructed from the sensor network graph and temporal sensor data to capture the joint space-time dependencies. Specifically, we propose a graph neural network-based model in conjunction with a recurrent neural network to impute missing information and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for downstream tasks. Experiments on a traffic sensor network reveal enhanced imputation accuracy and up to 69% reduction in mean absolute error and 61% reduction in root mean square error compared to state-of-the-art imputation frameworks.;;979-8-3503-3984-0;10.1109/CAI54212.2023.00032;"National Science Foundation; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10195107;"Spatiotemporal imputation;GNN;LSTM;Traffic data";"Recurrent neural networks;Databases;Transportation;Estimation;Prediction algorithms;Data structures;Spatiotemporal phenomena";"agriculture;data analysis;database management systems;environmental monitoring (geophysics);graph neural networks;mean square error methods;regression analysis;spatiotemporal phenomena";"control algorithms;data imputation;environmental monitoring;general spatiotemporal imputation framework;graph neural network;imputation accuracy;inherent spatial relationships;joint space time dependencies;missing data;missing information;missing sensor data;precision agriculture;recurrent neural network;sensor network graph;spatiotemporal data structure;spatiotemporal databases;spatiotemporal graph;state-of-the-art imputation frameworks;temporal sensor data;traffic sensor network;transportation networks";;;;18;IEEE;2.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Only a small percentage of them are helpful to people. However, most of them are harmful to people and can lead to fatal illnesses. Hence timely identification and taking necessary action is very important. Therefore, it's important to identify them quickly and take the appropriate steps to stop them. The first step in this would be the identification and classification of bacteria. Traditional or manual methods for classification include gram staining, motility testing, biochemical testing, and so on. But these methods are time-consuming and also require human expertise along with long training time to train the operators. Additionally, with the advancements in technology, a system for the automatic classification of bacteria can be developed using machine learning algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we aim in developing a system that uses machine learning techniques to create a system for automatically classifying bacteria, cutting down on the time required for the human procedure. As CNN is proven to be highly efficient for working with images, we are employing CNN for image processing. But due to the requirement of larger number of images for CNN training we are using a hybrid approach. Random Forest has been employed along with CNN for efficient classification. The system proved to be efficient with an accuracy of 98%.

Although controlled trials and historical data can provide rough estimates of crop production, their accuracy is low. Estimates of the agricultural yield may be subject to more than one type of bias. Recent advances in learning have enabled the efficient extraction of agricultural production statistics from remote sensing photos depending on the crop in the field, thereby assisting policymakers in the development of more effective policies and administration. To estimate crop yields, one can apply AI techniques such as deep learning or machine learning to remotely sensed images of crops of interest, classifying the images into dataset and image quality. In this study, we investigate how physical factors including soil, climate, and vegetation indices affect crop yields. The satellite data gathered from a distinct study site in the central portion of India is put through a series of statistical tests, including correlation and multiple regression analysis, to identify the parameters most likely to accurately predict crop yield.

Water streams will be passed directly through the plant roots which only grow to the required lengths instead of water streams or sprinklers in the soil which may cause severe water and nutrient losses as mentioned. Hydroponics farms are estimated to have an increase in crop cultivation and production by around 110 tons (160 tons to 270 tons). This is paired with a 90% improvement in water saving when compared to present systems.

It happens when the amount of moisture that can be held in the soil to suit a specific crop's needs is insufficient. India's drought has two main causes: climate change and a lack of surface water supplies. In some cases, it may be able to pinpoint the direct cause of a drought in a specific area, but this is not always the case. Consequently, it is imperative to establish an effective method for communicating the Standardized Precipitation Index SPI data revealing drought indices to farmers and strengthen drought and climate resilience in order to improve all these services in favour of improving agricultural productivity and decreasing food insecurity in India. Understanding past drought experiences with precise indicators is essential to developing future plans and policies in India's agriculture industry. Since this study would aid in India's agricultural development, it is obvious that a standardised drought index must be used to comprehend how frequently droughts are occurring across the country. The major goal of this study is to establish a suitable baseline for drought index forecasting using Standardized Precipitation Index SPI data. As a result, the project's ultimate result would be a knowledge base from which appropriate forecasting tools and distribution networks for farmers might be updated or established.

In addition, energy harvestable or wireless-powered wearable devices are envisioned to empower the edge intelligence in IoT applications. However, the intermittent energy supply and network connectivity of such devices in scenarios including remote areas and hard-to-reach regions such as in-body applications can limit the performance of edge computing-based IoT applications. Hence, deploying state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on such energy-constrained devices is not feasible due to their computational cost. Existing model compression methods, such as network pruning and quantization can reduce complexity, but these methods only work for fixed computational or energy requirements, which is not the case for edge devices with an intermittent energy source. In this work, we propose a pruning scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which can compress the CNN model adaptively according to the energy dictated by the energy management policy and accuracy requirements for IoT applications. The proposed energy policy uses predictions of energy to be harvested and dictates the amount of energy that can be used by the edge device for deep learning inference. We compare the performance of our proposed approach with existing state-of-the-art CNNs and data sets using different filter-ranking criteria and pruning ratios. We observe that by using DRL-driven pruning, the convolutional layers that consume relatively higher energy are pruned more as compared to their counterparts.

One such technology is the use of specific light color combinations to optimize the growth rate of plants. One obvious drawback is that plants’ color will change according to the light color combinations. The light color can fool human eyes and may cause errors when monitoring for plant anomalies. Color correction methods should be applied to help restore the natural plant color with the white light source from the unnaturally colored plant images. Our color correction method uses an application of self-dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and channel attention combined with a U-Net-based model. This proposed method performs the color correction with the input image in the RGB color space in two steps. First, a global transformation network provides the global function that maps the input RGB color vectors from every pixel and produces the corrected RGB color vectors. The global mapping function is the same for all pixels in the image.

Recent technological advances in the fields of picture imprisonment and data dispensation have greatly facilitated the solution of several agricultural issues. Identification and categorization of crop diseases are essential to the agricultural sector's technical and economic health. The first step in agricultural image processing is acquiring a digital colour photograph of a sick leaf. Grapes have the highest global per capita fruit consumption. It is unacceptable to let the spread of grape leaf contamination in the grapefruit crop to go unchecked, since this would be detrimental to the industry's growth. Farmers in rural regions sometimes lack the skills to spot these illnesses early on, which leads to poor crop yields.

K-means clustering is first used to segregate the backgrounds of the input datasets. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is then fed the segmented regions to get a disease classification.

Plant disease identification in plants is significant in the agricultural sector, as a disease in plants is very natural. In this setting, plants are susceptible to damage that reduces their quality, quantity, or production if proper precautions are not followed. Tomatoes are the most common crop globally, and they can be used in various ways in any kitchen, regardless of cuisine. It is the third most widely grown crop globally, after potatoes and sweet potatoes. India was ranked second in tomato production. However, the quality and quantity of tomato crops suffer from numerous diseases. As a result, the paper discusses a deep learning-based approach to disease detection. Outdated approaches focus on handcrafted features extracted from obtained images to regulate infection. The quality of the handmade elements selected is also crucial to the success of these works. This problem may be handled by using Convolutional Neural Networks for automated feature learning (CNN). The research presented here illustrates two different methods for identifying infected tomato leaves. Hyper-parameter learning with an optimization technique is employed first to study the important features, and the second design employs an attention mechanism.

This paper proposes a deep learning-based plant disease classification model using ResNet-50 architecture, which offers several advantages over existing methods. ResNet-50 allows accurate identification of plant diseases from images with high precision and recall, even when the diseases have similar visual characteristics. The ResNet-50 architecture has skip connections that help in reusing the learned features from previous layers, overcoming the problem of vanishing gradients and allowing it to train on deeper networks, resulting in improved accuracy compared to shallower models. Furthermore, transfer learning is utilized in the proposed model, enabling the use of pre-trained weights from a large dataset of general images, followed by fine-tuning on the plant disease dataset. This enhances the model’s performance by leveraging the pre-trained weights’ knowledge, leading to faster convergence, improved accuracy, and reduced training time. The model is trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset from 38 different categories of plant diseases and healthy leaves. This ensures that the model is robust and can accurately identify and classify diseases across various plant species. By leveraging the advantages of the ResNet-50 architecture and transfer learning, the proposed model can accurately and efficiently diagnose plant diseases, leading to improved agricultural productivity and reduced losses due to plant diseases.;;979-8-3503-3575-0;10.1109/INCET57972.2023.10170368;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10170368;"Plant Disease Diagnosis;Deep Learning;Image Classification;Convolutional Neural Networks;Agriculture;Transfer Learning";"Productivity;Training;Deep learning;Plant diseases;Visualization;Transfer learning;Pipelines";"agricultural products;agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;plant diseases";"automated plant disease diagnosis;deep learning-based plant disease classification model;efficiently diagnose plant diseases;optimized plant disease classification system;plant disease dataset;plant species;pre-trained weights;resnet-50 architecture;transfer learning";;;;15;IEEE;10.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

They use sensor data transmitted via IoT to remotely monitor their crops. Farmers today manage crops in a controlled environment to increase yields in the name of modern farming. Crop productivity, on the other hand, is influenced by the severity of the weather and disease variations. The primary objective of this paper is to present a novel Multisensor Machine-Learning Approach (MMLA) for classifying multisensor data. The fusion strategy supports high-quality data analysis in agricultural contexts for cultivation recommendations. Based on the proposed recommendation system, eight crops were classified: cotton, gram, groundnut, maize, moong, paddy, sugarcane, and wheat. Crop species were classified using three machine learning algorithms: J48 Decision Tree, Hoeffding Tree, and Random Forest. To evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-text classifier, only the top eight classes were investigated. The classifier’s performance is measured in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, MCC, ROC Area, and PRC Area class, and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers. The Random forest algorithm has the lowest error measure of RMSE at 13%, RAE at 38.67%, and RRSE at 44.21%, demonstrating effectiveness in classifying the agriculture text. Thus, the use of a multisensor data fusion approach based on crop recommendation provides greater precision in prediction, resulting in a significant increase in crop yield while also creating awareness in the condition-based environmental monitoring system.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249205;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054040;"Agriculture;crop yield;cultivation recommendation;farmers;multisensor;machine learning";"Crops;Agriculture;Sensors;Monitoring;Random forests;Classification algorithms;Data integration;Machine learning";"agriculture;crops;data analysis;decision trees;environmental monitoring (geophysics);Internet of Things;pattern classification;plant diseases;random forests;recommender systems;sensor fusion;sugar;text analysis";"agriculture text classification;condition-based environmental monitoring system;cotton;crop productivity;crop recommendation;crop species;crop yield;cultivation recommendations;disease variations;farming;gram;groundnut;high-quality data analysis;Hoeffding tree;IoT;J48 decision tree;maize;MMLA;moong;multisensor data classification;multisensor data fusion;multisensor machine-learning approach;multitext classifier;paddy;random forest;random forest algorithm;sugarcane;weather severity;wheat";;;;31;CCBYNCND;27.2.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

The earlier that an accurate yield estimation can be made the greater its value, increasing management options for grape growers and commercial options for winemakers. For the yield estimate based on in- field measurements at scale, the number of inflorescences emerging after bud-burst offers the earliest practical signal, allowing a yield potential to be determined months before harvest. This paper presents an approach to automatically count the inflorescence number at the phenological stage E-L 12 using RGB video data and demonstrates its use for estimating yield. A dataset consisting of RGB videos was collected shortly after bud-burst from multiple vineyards, in conjunction with hand counts to produce a manual ground-truth for the inflorescence counting task. The video frames were annotated using bounding-boxes around the inflorescences to produce a digital ground-truth. A deep learning architecture was developed to learn features from the video frames during training and detect the inflorescences at the later inference stage. The detection results were fed to a tracking pipeline built using computer vision and deep learning techniques to generate numbers of inflorescences present in test videos. The visual and quantitative results are presented and evaluated for the inflorescence detection and counting tasks. The developed inflorescence detector achieves an average precision of 80.00%, a recall of 83.92%, and an F1-score of 80.48%, through a five-fold cross-validation on the annotated dataset. For the test videos, the developed automatic inflorescence counting model reports an absolute error of 11.03 inflorescences per panel, a normalized mean absolute error of 10.80%, and an  $R^{2}$  of 0.86, when the predicted per-panel counts were compared to the corresponding manual ground-truth. Based on the counting results, we estimate an early yield that is within 4% to 11% error when compared to the actual yield after harvest. Based on these results and a separate analysis of the relationship between hand counts of inflorescences and harvest yields in three vineyards over three growing seasons, we conclude that computer vision and machine learning based methods have the potential to provide early yield estimation in viticulture with a commercially viable accuracy.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3263238;"Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, through their Rural Research and Development for Profit Scheme and Wine Australia; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10087292;"Grapevine;inflorescence detection;inflorescence tracking;early yield estimation;viticulture;computer vision;deep learning";"Videos;Yield estimation;Detectors;Pipelines;Australia;Task analysis;Feature extraction";"computer vision;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;wine industry";"accurate yield estimation;actual yield;bud-burst;corresponding manual ground-truth;counting results;counting tasks;deep learning architecture;deep learning techniques;developed automatic inflorescence counting model;developed inflorescence detector;digital ground-truth;early yield estimation;estimating yield;grapevine inflorescence detection;hand counts;harvest yields;inflorescence counting task;inflorescence number;inflorescences;per-panel counts;RGB video data;RGB videos;test videos;video frames;viticulture;wine industry value chain;yield estimate;yield potential";;1;;42;CCBYNCND;29.3.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

However, manually identifying productive fields is often time-consuming, costly, and subjective. Previous studies explore different methods to detect crop fields using advanced machine-learning (ML) algorithms to support the specialists’ decisions, but they often lack good quality labeled data. In this context, we propose a high-quality dataset generated by machine operation combined with Sentinel-2 images tracked over time. As far as we know, it is the first one to overcome the lack of labeled samples by using this technique. In sequence, we apply a semisupervised classification of unlabeled data and state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised deep-learning (DL) methods to detect productive crop fields automatically. Finally, the results demonstrate high accuracy in positive unlabeled (PU) learning, which perfectly fits the problem where we have high confidence in the positive samples.

However, the crop is vulnerable to many diseases. Research has revealed that image recognition using machine learning and deep learning techniques can be applied in automatic identification of cassava leaf diseases. Therefore this study focuses on using strongly discriminative features of the leaf regions affected by disease and weakening regions of low interest to improve the classification accuracy. A convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is a common attention mechanism integrated in feed-forward convolutional neural networks. In this study, CBAM is added to the pretrained ResNet50 and VGG19 models to recognize the cassava leaf regions affected by disease. This is done by sequentially inferring attention maps along two dimensions, channel and spatial for every intermediate feature map. The attention maps are then multiplied to the input feature map for adaptive feature refinement.

Time series of a signal contains vital information that can be used for predicting the future points in the series. However, such prediction requires careful analysis of the correlations in the time series. Getting the right number of past observations is a very important part of time-series forecasting (lags). We have used auto correlation in the time series of yield of Cotton of all over India from the period 1964-2020. This study employs a comparative analysis between three approaches to examine the accuracy of prediction based on suitable value of time lag. These include a statistical method based on the auto correlation function, the widely used machine learning method of regression analysis, and the best prediction is chosen based on the ideal time-lag value. An experimental data set with a single predictor was used to test the techniques i.e actual yield and its different lags moving a 1-step ahead, 2-step ahead and so on till 5 as a target values (predicted yield). Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared were the performance metrics. The investigation demonstrated that the proposed linear, multi linear regression and non-linear regression at degree 4 analysis is the better method for determining the best time-lag value.;;978-1-6654-9294-2;10.1109/OTCON56053.2023.10113947;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113947;"Regression Analysis;Forecasting;Machine Learning;crop Yielding";"Training;Time series analysis;Linear regression;Predictive models;Agriculture;Cotton;Autocorrelation";"agriculture;crops;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;regression analysis;time series";"auto correlation function;cotton agriculture yield;ideal time-lag value;machine learning method;multilinear regression;nonlinear regression;R-squared;regression model implementation;root mean square error;time series forecasting;yield prediction";;;;12;IEEE;8.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Today, in modern agriculture, diagnostic softwares by artificial intelligence can be used by farmers themselves with little time and cost. On the other hand, because diseases and pests of plants, especially rice leaves, are of different intensities and are similar to each other, automatic detection methods are more accurate and have less error. In this paper, two transfer learning methods for diagnosing rice leaf disease are investigated. The first method uses the CNN-based output of a pre-trained model and an appropriate classifier is added. In the second method, freezing the bottom layers, fine-tuning the weights in the last layers of the pre-trained network, and adding the appropriate classifier to the model are proposed. For this purpose, seven CNN models have been designed and evaluated. Simulation results show that four of these networks as: VGG16 network with fine tuning the last two layers, Inceptionv3 with fine tuning the last 12 layers, Resnet152v2 with fine tuning the last 5 and 6 layers reach 100% accuracy and an f1-score of 1.

Advances in technology, such as precision agriculture and the use of Deep learning algorithms, are helping to make this possible. A number of practical and technological challenges, including dataset collecting and labelling, variability in plant leaf images, inter-class similarity, imbalanced datasets, generalization, and real-time detection, are prevalent in the challenging task of detecting plant leaf disease. The main goal of utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for plant leaf disease detection is to precisely categorize images of plant leaves into categories of healthy or diseased. Depending on the particular application scenario, there could be additional goals that researchers try to accomplish with their CNN models in addition to this main one. Tomato is a widely cultivated vegetable and is an important food crop worldwide. Employing machine learning and image processing methods for detecting diseases in tomato plant leaves can be highly efficient. These techniques can be used to analyze images of tomato leaves taken in the field, and an accurate algorithm can be used to identify the presence of disease symptoms. One such approach is using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) algorithm which have been trained on a dataset of images of tomato leaves with and without disease symptoms. This can be done by gathering the images of the healthy tomato leaves and the infected ones and then training a CNN model to detect the difference.

It has been a fundamental activity for human societies throughout history, providing food and other resources necessary for survival. Hence plant diseases can have a significant impact on the economy, particularly in agricultural-dependent countries. Crop yield loss, trade restrictions, increased production costs and reduced agricultural productivity are some of the ways plant diseases can affect the economy. Farmers visually inspect their crops for symptoms of diseases, such as discoloration, spots, wilting, and deformities. Farmers can also use their sense of touch and smell to detect diseases, such as the sticky or slimy feel of plant leaves infected with fungal diseases and the foul smell of rotting or decaying plant material. However, traditional methods of plant disease detection do have limitations. Visual inspection and other traditional methods may not always detect diseases at an early stage, and there is a risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, conventional techniques may fail to identify illnesses that are not perceptible to the unaided observation. The other alternatives are the use of Artificial Intelligence(AI) which includes training computers to detect plant diseases using image recognition technology. These AI methods are increasingly being used for plant disease detection because they offer a fast, accurate, and cost-effective way to diagnose plant diseases, which can help prevent crop losses and increase yields.

In this context, this work presents a study on reference evapotranspiration ( $ET_{o}$ ) estimation models, having as input a limited set of meteorological parameters, namely: temperature, humidity, and wind. Since solar radiation (SR) is an important parameter in the determination of  $ET_{o}$ , SR estimation models are also developed. These  $ET_{o}$  and SR estimation models compare the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and hybrid neural network models such as LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, and GRU-ANN. Two main approaches were taken for  $ET_{o}$  estimation: (i) directly use those algorithms to estimate  $ET_{o}$ , and (ii) estimate solar radiation first and then use that estimation together with other meteorological parameters in a method that predicts  $ET_{o}$ . For the latter case, two variants were implemented: the use of the estimated solar radiation as (ii.1) a feature of the neural network regressors, and (ii.2) the use of the Penman-Monteith method (a.k.a. FAO-56PM method, adopted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) to compute  $ET_{o}$ , which has solar radiation as one of the input parameters. Using experimental data collected from a weather station (WS) located in Vale do Lobo (Portugal), the later approach achieved the best result with a coefficient of determination  $(R^{2})$  of 0.977. The developed model was then applied to data from eleven stations located in Colorado (USA), with very distinct climatic conditions, showing similar results to the ones for which the models were initially designed ( $R^{2}>0.95$ ), proving a good generalization. As a final notice, the reduced-set features were carefully selected so that they are compatible with free online weather forecast services.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3233301;"Project GSSIC—Green Spaces SMART Irrigation Control(grant numbers:ALG-01-0247-FEDER-047030); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10003192;"Artificial neural networks;evapotranspiration;public garden;smart irrigation;solar radiation";"Solar radiation;Meteorology;Crops;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Irrigation";"agriculture;evaporation;hydrological techniques;transpiration;weather forecasting";"artificial neural networks;evapotranspiration prediction;free online weather forecast services;gated recurrent unit;GRU-ANN;hybrid neural network based models;hybrid neural network models;limited weather parameters;long short term memory;LSTM-ANN;meteorological parameters;neural network regressors;recurrent neural network;reference evapotranspiration;RNN-ANN;solar radiation;SR estimation models;water management policies";;3;;53;CCBY;29.12.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

However, the highest degree of similarity between weed and the desired crop as well as the existence of wide range of weeds affect the classification accuracy.

LDR feature selection is used to reduce the classification problem to selecting features of medicinal plants. Leaves are commonly used to identify medicinal plants, branches, flowers, petals, seeds and whole plants for use in automated procedures.

In order to improve the quality of production while reducing the usage of pollutants agriculture uses data mining to analyse the many different environmental factors. Agriculture is the primary contributor to India's economy and accounts for most of the country's workforce. The majority of Indian farmers have the same issue: they do not choose the most suitable crop for their land based on the needs of their environment. As a result, they will see a major decline in their total level of productivity. Precision agriculture has provided a solution to the problem that the farmers were experiencing. The term “precision agriculture” refers to a contemporary farming practice that uses collected research data on soil features and kinds, as well as crop yields, and then recommends to farmers the kind of crop that would yield the most in that specific area. This leads to a decrease in crop selection errors and an increase in yield. This paper proposes a recommendation system through an ensemble model with a majority voting technique that uses a Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost as learners to recommend a crop for the site-specific parameters with high accuracy and efficiency. This problem is solved as a result of the implementation of this system.

This study presents a novel approach for the multi-classification of Wheat Stripe Rust (WSR) disease into 5 different severity levels using the You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLOv4) model. The model was trained on a dataset of 5000 images and achieved a mean average precision (mAP) score of 0.85 and overall accuracy of 85.98%, demonstrating high accuracy and performance across all severity levels.

Ripe fruit may now be picked. Predicting when fruit will be ripe and of better condition is crucial not just for farmhand and the food business, but also for grocery shops and corner markets. The term “fruit maturity classification” refers to the method through which fruits are categorized based on their stage of development. Machine learning (ML) is being used in a wide variety of smart agricultural use cases, including soil and water management, seeding crops, early diagnosis, weed elimination, crop dispersal, crop collection, and productivity prediction. The purpose of this research is to identify the most effective deep learning algorithms for estimating fruit ripeness and quality to extend their storage life. Banana fruit datasets are utilized in this investigation. To increase the total no of images in the collection, image augmentation is utilized.

Therefore, with the technological development of computer versions, deep learning is attended for visual inspection. Deep learning-based anomaly detection models have attracted attention and are applied for visual inspection in the industry. However, few studies have performed experiments on crops in agriculture. In this paper, we propose defect detection method for apples as a representative example of fruits. We use PatchCore, which is one of the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, while changing feature extractor, which is trained by ImageNet. In experiment 1, we train the model with normal images, inference with the test images, and evaluate the model. According to the experiment1 results, WideResNet50 is the most effective feature extractor. Furthermore, it can be seen that the tip of the branch of the apple is erroneously detected as a defective portion. From experiment 1 result, in experiment 2, input data are preprocessed using YOLOv7 and OpenCV to remove the branch tip portion of an apple, and we evaluated in the same way as in experiment 1.

Deep learning can be particularly useful for classifying low-light images because it can impulsively learn features from the data that can be relevant for classification. This is especially important in low light conditions where the image may be noisy or contain artefacts that are not relevant to the task. In the experiment, the plant seedlings and weedlings dataset consisting of low light images are subjected to a deep-learning model. Low-light images tend to have poor image quality due to the limited amount of available light. This results in a very low signal-to-noise ratio, making extracting beneficial information from the images extremely ambiguous.

Farmers in West Nusa Tenggara usually cultivate rice crops in all of their paddy fields, as rice is a staple food for the Indonesian community. Therefore, rice production needs to increase every year, while rice harvests in West Nusa Tenggara have experienced fluctuations in the past three years, despite the requirement for high production. These fluctuations are caused by bird pests in rice crops, resulting in a loss of harvest yield of up to 30-50%. To address this issue, this research aims to develop an artificial intelligence model to detect bird pests in rice crops in real-time using the YOLOv5 method, specifically the S type. The YOLOv5 method was chosen for its ability to detect objects with high accuracy and fast processing speed, as demonstrated in previous research in other domains. However, there has been no research implementing this method specifically for detecting bird pests in rice crops. In this study, the authors developed a YOLOv5s model trained with 100 epochs and a batch size of 16. The training results showed the best accuracy of 96%. This finding indicates that the YOLOv5s model has great potential in detecting objects resembling bird pests in rice crops. The successful development of this model contributes significantly, both scientifically and practically, to efforts in reducing harvest losses caused by bird pest attacks. In further research, it is hoped that the development of this model can be expanded to detect other types of bird pests and widely applied in agricultural practices in West Nusa Tenggara and other regions.;;979-8-3503-0341-4;10.1109/ICADEIS58666.2023.10270848;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10270848;"Farmers;Bird Pests;YOLOv5;Rice Crops;Object Detection";"Training;Fluctuations;Sociology;Crops;Production;Birds;Real-time systems";"agriculture;artificial intelligence;crops;neural nets;object detection;pest control";"artificial intelligence;bird pest attacks;bird pest detection;farming;Indonesian community;object detection;paddy fields;rice crops;rice harvests;rice production;West Nusa Tenggara province;YOLOv5 method;You Only Look Once v5";;;;14;IEEE;5.10.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The existing cropland map based on remote sensing mainly focuses on moderate to coarse spatial resolution, and these products are generally unsuitable for precision agriculture due to the lack of spatial details. Therefore, there is an urgent need to produce high-resolution (HR) cropland maps to meet current application demands. Recently, the typical classification workflow of HR images employs deep learning models combined with manually annotated samples, and visual interpretation of samples is usually labor-intensive and time-consuming, which is not conducive to large-scale applications. To address this problem, this article proposes an automated HR cropland extraction solution, namely, refinement–reclassification–extraction (RRE), including 1) refinement of 10-m spatial resolution cropland products; 2) reclassifying cropland using the refined product as a sample source; and 3) extracting HR cropland via designed cross-scale sample transfer. The strength of the proposed framework is that it leverages the existing moderate-resolution public products as prior knowledge and provides cross-scale transferable samples for HR images. The whole process does not require manual labeling of samples and is highly automated. Specifically, the experimental results in the three main grain production regions show that the RRE framework effectively reduces the interference of road networks and ridges, and F1 scores of extracted 1-m HR cropland reaches 87.71%–94.16%, which is comparable to the fully supervised (FS) cropland extraction method.

Plant diseases are the main reason why agricultural productivity has declined in both quality and volume. It is extremely difficult for a farmer to recognize and manage plant illnesses. The majority of plant illnesses manifest in the leaves of the affected plant. The illness that harms a plant is recognized using leaf photos. This proposed system focuses on certain deep-learning techniques to identify plant illnesses while also proposing which crop variety is optimal for production in that specific area. To make the proposed system more robust, proper training and testing have been shown with leaf datasets. The information set contains both healthy and unhealthy leaf images which are reported.

The difficulty of predicting postharvest degradation of apples while in storage is addressed in this article. For the prediction of postharvest decay zones, we used the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method in conjunction with the Mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For validating this idea, we have designed a small greenhouse equipped with necessary sensors and actuators for simulating storage conditions for apples. We collected a dataset which includes 552 images of apples stored under the extreme temperatures and humidity. For DMD reconstructed images demonstrating the growth dynamics of decay in apples, the proposed approach achieves 0.999 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and 66.813 peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Mask R-CNN predicted postharvest decay zones in apples with an average precision (AP) of 83.809% and F1-score with 83.307%.

The CNN and AE models are then trained and tested on the datasets, and their performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score. A qualitative study of the output images provided by both algorithms are analysed. According to findings, both the CNN and AE models are capable of accurately identifying agricultural land from satellite images, while the CNN model does so marginally more efficiently than the AE model. Both models were able to capture the key characteristics of agricultural land since their output images had a visually comparable appearance. Proposed work reveals that deep learning methods like CNN and AE may be employed well for satellite image-based agricultural land detection. Although both models are effective, the CNN model outperforms the AE model only barely. Proposed findings may be helpful in enhancing agricultural yield predictions, land management strategies, and disaster preparedness strategies.;;979-8-3503-2579-9;10.1109/ICAISS58487.2023.10250510;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10250510;"Convolutional Neural Network;CNN;Autoencoder;AE;Deep Learning";"Deep learning;Training;Visualization;Crops;Soil;Prediction algorithms;Satellite images";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);disasters;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing";"AE model;agricultural yield predictions;CNN model;deep learning algorithms;deep learning methods;land management strategies;managing land management;remote sensing technologies;satellite image-based agricultural land detection;satellite images;testing datasets";;;;15;IEEE;22.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

An Enhanced Deep Learning Algorithms for Image Recognition and Plant Leaf Disease Detection;V. Asha;Department of Master of Computer Application, New Horizon College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India;2023 Second International Conference on Augmented Intelligence and Sustainable Systems (ICAISS);22.9.2023;2023;;;611;615;Object recognition in photographs has only been possible with the advent of modern deep learning (DL) techniques. Following its success in other fields, DL techniques are increasingly being used to a broad variety of agricultural operations. Due to its intrinsic complexity, image-based plant disease detection is difficult to solve. Targeted management relies on more than just detection and requires accurate identification of each species. An automated disease detection system aids the farmer by providing a speedy and accurate diagnosis of plant illness. Accelerating agricultural diagnostics requires the development of an automated system for identifying plant leaf diseases. Using machine learning and image processing, the authors of this study outline a strategy for detecting leaf blight. A photo of a leaf may be fed into this framework. In a first processing stage, noise is eliminated from the leaf images. The mean filter may be used to get rid of noise. Histogram equalisation is a method for enhancing image quality. Segmentation is a technique used in photography to break a large image down into more manageable sections. This helps to establish the picture's limits. The image is broken up using the BIRCH (Balance Iterative Reducing and Clustering utilising Hierarchies) technique. For this purpose of feature extraction, fine grained classification model, a convolutional neural network is used. After that, the pictures are categorized using a variety of methods, one of which is RCNN (Region based Convolutional neural network). Using this approach, this study discovered the split ratio, computational time, and as a result RCNN has resulted in a high accuracy of 0.98 when detecting the leaf compared to other algorithms.;;979-8-3503-2579-9;10.1109/ICAISS58487.2023.10250727;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10250727;"leaf detection;RCNN;Split Ratio;Computing Time;CNN";"Deep learning;Training;Photography;Plant diseases;Image recognition;Plants (biology);Performance analysis";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image recognition;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object recognition;plant diseases";"agricultural diagnostics;agricultural operations;automated disease detection system;automated system;convolutional neural network;DL techniques;enhanced deep learning algorithms;image processing;image quality;image recognition;image-based plant disease detection;intrinsic complexity;leaf blight;leaf images;machine learning;modern deep learning techniques;object recognition;plant illness;plant leaf disease detection;plant leaf diseases;processing stage;speedy diagnosis;targeted management";;;;15;IEEE;22.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Traditional techniques for diagnosing these illnesses can be expensive and time-consuming. To solve this problem, researchers are investigating the potential of intelligent systems that depend on the advanced deep-learning architecture.

Currently, scientific document category identification is done manually. There are already defined taxonomies available for categorizing scientific documents, such as the Association for Computing Machinery Computing Classification System (ACM CCS) and Bibsonomy. These taxonomies facilitate authors in the categories of their manuscripts. The incorporation of research work from a variety of domains in the assignment takes on the form of a Multi-Label Classification (MLC). Using MLC, it is possible to assign more than one class to a single document. To address the problem of MLC in its entirety, two distinct methods are used (Problem Transformation and Algorithm Adaptation). The MLC dataset is transformed into one or more single-label datasets through the application of the problem transformation technique. Whereas, a single classifier is modified during the algorithm adaptation process so that it can predict multiple labels. Currently, document classification is done using various techniques in the literature, but none of them paid much attention to the problem of imbalance in Multi-Label Datasets (MLD). However, many effective techniques for dealing with imbalance are available in the literature. The goal of this study is to find an effective technique for balancing datasets before multi-label classification to get better predictions for the classes with fewer instances. Six MLDs, nine transformation techniques and seven classifiers are evaluated in this research work. The proposed research will result in a more accurate recommendation of a research topic for a document. For imbalanced MLDs, LPROS is the best resampling technique using statistical tests. When compared to the other classifiers, the BRkNN classifier is better for MLC.

Measuring the biophysical properties, such as leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll (Cab) content, is the key to properly following the growth cycle of crops. In this perspective, we propose an innovative approach for monitoring landscape-scale biophysical properties of wheat and barley field crops using Sentinel-2 time-series imagery based on accurate 3-D direct and inverse radiative transfer modeling. It relies on an original 3-D radiative transfer models (RTM) emulator architecture based on a residual artificial neural network (ResNet). We employed the well-known discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate Sentinel-2 images and generate a database that serves to train and validate the ResNet emulator. To do it, two realistic mockups, both composed of soil and 3-D wheat plants, are set up. The first mockup mimics the wheat and barley from their start of growth to their full growth, and the second reproduces the features of the wheat and barley plant when they turn yellowish and mature for harvesting. Besides, we extract the bare soil spectra signature from Sentinel-2 images acquired before sowing. Results of the proposed emulator show its similarity to DART simulation while it is much faster. These emulator features make it possible to adapt an inversion technique based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), specifically, as a novelty, a continuous MCMC. The latter exploits the emulator to perform the iterative sampling processing on all continuous values in allowed intervals according to each sought biophysical property until converging to its respective posterior distribution. The proposed scheme of RTM emulator inversion based on continuous MCMC and using Sentinel-2 imagery is called “REMI.” It ensures high retrieval performances, which reach an RMSE equal to 0.06 and 0.1 for LAI and Cab, respectively.;1558-0644;;10.1109/TGRS.2023.3297363;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10189353;"Artificial neuronal network (ANN);crop biophysical properties monitoring;emulator;MCMC;sentinel-2 time series";"Crops;Three-dimensional displays;Biological system modeling;Monitoring;Vegetation mapping;Solid modeling;Reflectivity";"crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;radiative transfer;vegetation mapping";"3-D radiative transfer models emulator architecture;3-D wheat plants;agriculture management systems;ANN-based 3-D-RTM emulator;bare soil spectra signature;barley field crops;barley plant;chlorophyll content;continuous MCMC technique;crop biophysical properties;crop growth;discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model;emulator features;inverse radiative transfer modeling;inversion technique;landscape-scale biophysical properties;leaf area index;Markov Chain Monte Carlo;posterior distribution;REMI;residual artificial neural network;ResNet emulator;RTM emulator inversion;Sentinel-2 time-series imagery";;;;43;IEEE;20.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

The realization of automatic grading is an urgent requirement in the tobacco industry. To address this need, we developed assembly line equipment and an RGB image classification method for tobacco grading. There is little difference in appearance between different grades of tobacco leaves, but there are some differences in high-level semantic features; therefore, tobacco grading is fundamentally a fine-grained visual categorization task. It is difficult to classify tobacco using hand-crafted image features. Therefore, in our method, we use a pyramid structure, attention mechanism, and angle decision loss function to improve the bilinear convolutional neural network (a fine-grained visual categorization framework) for tobacco grading. The feature extraction and classification model was trained using 66,966 images, to effectively extract high-level semantic features from a global tobacco image and multi-scale features from a local tobacco image.

Due to this, predicting crop yield before plantation is becoming one of the overriding strides of this era. Even before planting a crop, it is very important to predict the yield due to the frequent changes in the parameters involved. Usually, crop/plant production will be based on various geographical strategies, while analyzing such parameters using machine/deep learning algorithms helps to choose the crops that correspond to the geographical region. It will serve as a preventative measure that helps to reduce agricultural losses while also enhancing the productivity and quality of the crops that are produced. In this regard, various Machine learning models and Deep Neural Network models are employed to analyze the various geographical parameters that influence agricultural production. In this study, yield prediction is calculated in terms of state, district, area, and season for every crop/plant wise. It helps the farmers to select appropriate crops at the right place and time. The preciseness of the prediction is evaluated using various parameters such as accuracy, mean absolute error, and mean square error.

Self-supervised learning techniques alleviate this problem, however, existing methods are not optimized for dense prediction tasks in agricultural domains which results in degraded performance. In this work, we address this limitation with our proposed Injected Noise Discriminator (INoD) which exploits principles of feature replacement and dataset discrimination for self-supervised representation learning. INoD interleaves feature maps from two disjoint datasets during their convolutional encoding and predicts the dataset affiliation of the resultant feature map as a pretext task. Our approach enables the network to learn unequivocal representations of objects seen in one dataset while observing them in conjunction with similar features from the disjoint dataset. This allows the network to reason about higher-level semantics of the entailed objects, thus improving its performance on various downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce the novel Fraunhofer Potato 2022 dataset consisting of over 16,800 images for object detection in potato fields.

Most deep learning models tend to capture type-specific features to maximize the prediction performances on specific link types. However, the types of missing links are uncertain in heterogeneous social networks; this restricts the prediction performances of existing deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose a multi-type transferable method ($MTTM$MTTM) for missing link prediction in heterogeneous social networks, which exploits adversarial neural networks to remain robust against type differences. It comprises a generative predictor and a discriminative classifier. The generative predictor can extract link representations and predict whether the unobserved link is a missing link. To generalize well for different link types to improve the prediction performance, it attempts to deceive the discriminative classifier by learning transferable feature representations among link types. In order not to be deceived, the discriminative classifier attempts to accurately distinguish link types, which indirectly helps the generative predictor judge whether the learned feature representations are transferable among link types. Finally, the integrated $MTTM$MTTM is constructed on this minimax two-player game between the generative predictor and discriminative classifier to predict missing links based on transferable feature representations among link types.

To be specific, paddy is one of the globally significant cereal crops and extremely important for decision-making and crop management. Although there exist more crop yield prediction methods, but lacks a better outcome in paddy yield prediction. Attaining optimal crop yield was always a difficult task for the farmer because of changeable ecological conditions. The main factor for uncertainty of crop yield are changing nature of weather, land types, and availability of resources. Hence, the scientists around the world making continuous efforts to find methods, which can precisely and efficiently predict the crop, yield in much advance such that the agronomists can make best course of action to encounter the future challenges. Rice yield prediction includes estimation of the amount of rice that would be produced in a specific area, generally a region or a farm, related to several factors that could affect the crop yield. Therefore, this article introduces an Automated Rice Crop Yield Prediction using Sine Cosine Algorithm with Weighted Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (SCA-WRELM). The proposed SCA-WRELM technique aims to forecast the rice crop productivity effectually. To do this, the SCA-WRELM technique performs min-max data normalization process to scale the data into uniform format. For yield prediction, the SCA-WRELM technique uses WRELM model to forecast the rice productivity. Finally, the SCA is exploited for the optimal parameter tuning of the WRELM model and it results in improved predictive results. The simulation values of the SCA-WRELM approach is tested on rice yield dataset and the outcomes demonstrate the improved outcomes of the SCA-WRELM approach over other existing methods.;2768-5330;979-8-3503-9725-3;10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142403;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142403;"Rice yield prediction;Agriculture;Machine learning;Sine cosine algorithm;Crop productivity";"Productivity;Uncertainty;Extreme learning machines;Biological system modeling;Crops;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms";"agriculture;crops;ecology;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;least squares approximations;regression analysis";"Automated Rice Crop Yield Prediction;crop management;crop yield prediction methods;globally significant cereal crops;improved predictive results;optimal crop yield;paddy yield prediction;rice crop productivity;rice yield dataset;Rice yield prediction;Sine Cosine Algorithm;Weighted Regularized Extreme Learning Machine";;;;17;IEEE;8.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

This paper presents a computer vision-based automated 3D point cloud processing framework for accurate estimation of essential phenotypic traits. The framework relies on three steps involving sub-plot detection, extraction of the crop from each sub-plot, and estimating the required trait. Four essential phenotypic traits are estimated as a use case of the proposed framework, namely, plant height, leaf area index (LAI), leaf inclination, and plant count. The crop of interest is mung bean. The obtained estimates for plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and leaf inclination are statistically validated by comparing the results with ground truth data in terms of coefficient of determination, root mean squared error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient. These metrics are found to be, on average, 0.87, 0.05, and 0.93 respectively. The regression analysis has also been performed to gain analytical insights into the data.

However, due to a lack of education, accurate information, and India's rapid climate change, farmers frequently produce the same crops or the incorrect crops, regardless of whether they are appropriate given the soil, climate, and other elements in that particular place or not. This has caused an impact negatively on agricultural crop efficiency and output over the past few decades. Predicting the absolutely correct crops to grow based on the most important parameters for crop production would be of good help to farmers in choosing the right crops, improving crop quality, production and yield. In order to tackle the above problem, we have worked on a project using Naive Bayes Classification Machine Learning algorithm and Web Scraping. Our project consists of a friendly interactive chatbot with which the farmers can easily interact. The chatbot would make the farmer to provide some of the important parameters for crop production and would also fetch real time data through Web Scraping. The results of the crop prediction would be available to the farmer through that chatbot itself. By analyzing the parameters such as current weather conditions, location, soil, season and many more, our crop prediction system will be able to predict the right crops for the farmers to grow.

In consequence, increasing crop production through traditional farming methods will not address the global food scarcity problem. As a precision agriculture approach, aeroponics, a soilless agriculture technique, can assist in cultivating in-demand food crops, which will help serve the people. Because aeroponics is an indoor farming technology, factors such as pH, EC, light, temperature, PPM, and turbidity will affect crop growth. Hence, monitoring an aeroponic crop growth system efficiently is crucial for achieving a high crop yield and reducing the need for food crops. Even though, many crop monitoring systems use IoT and machine learning algorithms, their prediction accuracy is not up to the level and if they are deployed in the real world, they may not meet customer expectations. In order to efficiently monitor crops, more advanced models are needed. However, understanding the large volume of data can be very tedious.

Quantifying the extent of surface meltwater in Antarctica on a large scale is a challenging task. Traditional methods, such as thresholding, have many limitations. We used a deep learning method, the U-Net with attention blocks, to automatically extract surface meltwater from Sentinel-2 images. We inserted attention mechanism blocks into U-Net to assign different weights to all pixels and channels to utilize the high resolution and multiple channels of Sentinel-2 images.

Studying surface meltwater dynamics on the AIS is useful for understanding the East Antarctic mass balance and demonstrating the model performance. We analyzed the classification results for surface water bodies on the AIS from January 2017 to 2022.

The identification of extreme events at a regional scale is essential since the impact due to climate change could become devastating and extended. Significant changes in climate trends make it difficult to predict extreme events. In this study, the variability of precipitation from 1991 to 2021 was analyzed at five meteorological stations of the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA). The data used are publicly available in open sources. The statistical analysis of the accumulated precipitation at each station shows that the stations of Tacuarembó and Salto Grande, located in the country's northern region, have a higher annual accumulated precipitation. Due to the nature of the precipitation records, a classical decomposition was performed to analyze the time series, revealing better results for the additive model and showing the seasonality in the data. This information is used to describe the behavior of the precipitation records with the possibility of making projections of the extreme events identified. The decomposition results revealed the presence of extreme events, such as heavy rainfall and prolonged periods of drought. For heavy rain events, the maximum rainfall values were determined for each station and the return periods were calculated using the Gumbel probability. The Salto Grande station is the station with the highest seasonal precipitation records for spring, summer and fall for a return period of 10 years.;;979-8-3503-3337-4;10.1109/ICPRS58416.2023.10179084;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179084;;"Rain;Additives;Statistical analysis;Droughts;Time series analysis;Probability;Predictive models";"agriculture;atmospheric precipitation;rain;statistical analysis;time series";"extreme rainfall events;heavy rain events;heavy rainfall;higher annual accumulated precipitation;highest seasonal precipitation records;time 10.0 year";;;;20;IEEE;18.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Aquaponics is emerging as a viable alternative to food cultivation techniques but lacks efficiency, hindering its adoption on a large-scale production basis. The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in smart aquaponic farming can further contribute to increasing the yield in aquaponics. In the study, both linear and non-linear regression algorithms such as linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, KNN regression, SVR, and decision tree regression were trained on aquaponic fish pond dataset, evaluated on the basis of multiple metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMSLE, and a competitive analysis was done to determine the best algorithm for predicting the harvest weight of the fish in aquaponic ponds. The results showed that KNN regression and decision tree regression algorithms have lowest error and highest accuracy of 99.15% and 99.1% respectively, for predicting the harvest weight of the fish.

Existing models have made great efforts in capturing and fusing multimodal semantics of news for classification. However, they overlooked mitigating inconsistency between different modalities, which may result in learning biased statistical information. Therefore, we propose a mitigating multimodal inconsistency contrastive learning framework (MMICF), which mitigates inconsistency in multi-modal relations for fake news detection. Inspired by various forms of artificial fake news, we summarize two patterns of multimodal inconsistency: local and global inconsistency. To mitigate local inconsistency in multimodal relations, we use a causal-relation reasoning module by causally removing the direct effects of the textual and visual entities. Considering the influence of global inconsistency in multimodal semantics, our contrastive learning framework mitigates the semantic deviation of contrastive text-image objectives, which are constrained into a unified semantic space by a modal unified module. Thus, our MMICF can jointly mitigate local and global inconsistency for further maximally exploiting multimodal consistent semantics for fake news detection. The extensive experimental results show that the MMICF can improve the performance of multimodal fake news detection and provide a novel paradigm for mitigating multimodal inconsistency contrastive learning.;1945-788X;978-1-6654-6891-6;10.1109/ICME55011.2023.00486;"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220046;"Fake news Detection;Contrastive Learning;Mitigating multimodal Inconsistency";"Visualization;Semantics;Cognition;Fake news";"image classification;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);text analysis";"artificial fake news;causal-relation reasoning module;contrastive text-image objectives;global inconsistency;local inconsistency;MMICF;multimodal consistent semantics;multimodal fake news detection;multimodal inconsistency contrastive learning framework;multimodal relations";;;;24;IEEE;25.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

So, in precision agriculture, a high-throughput estimation of the wheat plant's height in terms of its spikes is essential. This study aims to develop a straightforward, cost-effective method for measuring the height of wheat plants using stereo cameras. To collect the required datasets, we conducted an experiment in which we collected RGB images along with their depth layer using two renowned stereo cameras, OAKD and D455. Then, we used a deep learning model called mask region-based convolutional neural networks to localize and distinguish the spikes in the collected images. In this study, we localized the wheat spikes using object detection (OD) and instance segmentation (IS) models. The advantage of the OD model over the IS model is that its bounding box annotation procedure in the data preparation phase is significantly faster than the IS model's polygon annotation. However, the disadvantage of OD is that there are many background pixels in each predicted bounding box, which reduces the performance of height estimation. To facilitate the annotation process of the collected datasets, we also developed a hybrid scale-invariant feature transform random forest-based active learning algorithm to transfer the annotations of one camera to the other. The results show that the OAKD camera performs better than the D455 camera for wheat plant height estimation due to its higher RGB quality and better matching of the mono camera images. Using the OAKD camera and IS model, the algorithm proposed in this study is able to estimate wheat height with mean absolute percentage error values of 0.75% and 0.67% at the spike and plot levels, respectively.;2771-9529;;10.1109/TAFE.2023.3262748;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105651;"Computer vision;deep learning (DL);high-throughput phenotyping;stereo camera;wheat height estimation";"Cameras;Imaging;Estimation;Location awareness;Computational modeling;Sensors;Green products";"agriculture;cameras;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image colour analysis;image segmentation;object detection;random forests;stereo image processing";"bounding box annotation procedure;data preparation phase;deep learning model;depth layer;hybrid scale-invariant feature transform random forest-based active learning algorithm;instance segmentation;IS model;mask region-based convolutional neural networks;mono camera images;OAKD camera;OD model;positive correlation;precision agriculture;wheat plant height estimation;wheat spikes height estimation";;;;76;IEEE;19.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

These grains are necessary for the pollination and fertilization processes, which are vital for the continued existence and diversification of plant species. Botanists and scholars have been interested in the identification and categorization of pollen grains for many years. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed in this study for the classification of pollen grains from a dataset of 805 photos with 23 annotated classes and an image resolution of 128 × 128 pixels with 3 color channels. The images of pollen grains from 23 plant species make up the publicly accessible Pollen Grain Dataset, which provided the dataset for this study. Based on the physical traits and properties of the pollen grains, the suggested CNN model is intended to properly categorize the pollen grains. The performance of the suggested CNN model is evaluated using various performance metrics. The CNN model’s categorization of pollen grains had an accuracy rate of 87.60%. The outcomes of this study’s investigation show how well CNN models can categorize pollen grains. Compared to manual categorization, which may be error-prone and time-consuming, this automated technique can save a lot of time and effort. According to the observations, the suggested CNN model is efficient at classifying pollen grains and may be applied to several tasks, including recognizing diverse pollen species for use in environmental study, agricultural practice, and scientific inquiry.;;979-8-3503-1120-4;10.1109/WCONF58270.2023.10235195;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10235195;"CNN;Deep Learning;Digital Image Processing Pollen Grains;Sustainable Agriculture;Organic Systems";"Measurement;Image resolution;Image color analysis;Biological system modeling;Plants (biology);Microscopy;Manuals";"agriculture;botany;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image classification;image resolution";"pollen grains;publicly accessible Pollen Grain Dataset;suggested CNN model";;;;16;IEEE;4.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The spread of numerous diseases on grapes’ fruit, stem, and leaves causes a decline in production. Bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc. are the principal culprits behind leaf diseases. Diseases are a significant influence in restricting the yield of fruit, and they are frequently challenging to control. Correct control measures cannot be implemented at the right time for a disease without an accurate illness identification. One of the most popular methods for identifying and categorizing plant leaf infections is image processing. This study uses the Xception classification approach to help identify and categorize grape leaf diseases and datasets taken from an online source like Kaggle.

Plant diseases may be identified and diagnosed using traditional methods, but these procedures can be laborious and complicated. As the process is complicated, it is easy for a plant disease to be misdiagnosed which can lead to further damage to the plant. Thus, to overcome the problems faced by traditional methods, diagnosing a plant disease in early stages, and increase the reliability of the diagnosis obtained, deep learning can be used for classification of plant diseases. This paper aims to increase agricultural productivity and ensure food security by preventing crops from being affected by plant diseases through timely diagnosis and accurate classification.

Due to the large number of dairy cattle housed in various dairies, dairy owners and local governments struggle to maintain and monitor their health. A health management method must include continuous monitoring of each cow's health as well as rapid identification and treatment of sick animals. To do this, sensor technology is employed to measure essential animal properties such as heart rate and temperature.

Hyperspectral imaging has been increasingly used for crop discrimination, yield estimation, disease detection, etc. However, most of the studies have focused on regional or field-level mapping units. For effective intervention at the farmer level, crop / soil information at sub-field, preferably at the plant level is vital. Further, the crop-specific information has to be obtained in a near-real time for time critical interventions. Traditional method of image classification which requires expert-driven model initiation and ground truth data acquisition is not suitable for time-critical image analysis. A method which can analyse imagery on the go and without human intervention is essential. The distinct spectral fingerprints of objects characterized by hyperspectral imagery prove a basis for automated spectral imaging analysis. A methodological perspective, transfer learning, is a viable approach for effective utilization of spectral knowledge characterized in a previous image analysis task for classifying imagery at a different space and time level. We present a spectral matching based transfer learning method for automated classification of drone based hyperspectral for plant level crop discrimination.

The potato plant, also known as Solanum tuberosum, is a significant crop that is planted all over the world and yields copious amounts of nutritious tubers. The potato is a frequent staple food and has several health benefits. When ingested in moderation, the fluid extracted from tubers can cure stomach ulcers and reduce inflammation and acidity. Both Early and Late Blight are dangerous and widespread potato diseases. We would concentrate on Late Blight in this effort. A fatal fungus that harms potatoes is called Late Blight. It is accessible everywhere in the world. It can be found in areas of the world where potatoes are grown. Winter is the primary growing season for potatoes in India. It is followed by sweltering summer months in the lowlands. Heat and dryness kill the fungus that lives in the soil. The fungus Phytophthora Infestans, the most prevalent agricultural disease that causes the Late blight of potatoes, can quickly result in crop failure if appropriate control measures are not adopted. Potato crop declines in epidemic years might be as high as 80%. We acquired a collection of roughly one thousand samples of Late Blight-affected leaves of potatoes for this investigation. With the help of conventional classifier algorithms, we have developed a machine-learning classification paradigm that may be able to forecast the onset of Late Blight disease.

India is recognized as the world's top tea consumer and the second-largest producer of tea. This industry provides both direct and indirect employment to millions of individuals, especially those residing in rural areas, where it serves as a primary source of income. The growing popularity of deep learning has led to a significant increase in research interest in image recognition technologies, particularly in fields such as computerized image classification and the detection of plant diseases. Each year India produces a huge amount of tea leading to an increase in the economy. However, there is also a vast volume of tea waste because of the tea leaf disease which is required to be resolved to keep the constant industry's success. Diseases affecting tea leaves can impact their growth rate, thus affecting the crop's overall yield. Therefore, this study aims to develop a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model to diagnose tea plant diseases using a collection of leaf images. CNN is an ideal model for this application as it can effectively analyze both tea leaves and other plant leaves to improve diagnostic accuracy.

If not controlled within a certain time frame, these plant diseases, which are typically brought on by pests, insects, and pathogens, have a significant negative impact on productivity. This research proposed auto encoders rooting convolutional neural network model to control these paddy diseases, and it has been implemented with various per-trained models like Vgg16, Resnet50, and inceptionV6. This model accurately determines whether a paddy plant is healthy or has one of four different types of paddy diseases. These models were developed, tested using auto encoders and a dataset of thermal pictures that was made available to the public, and they achieved the maximum model accuracy of 90.6%.

To improve the quality control of cocoa, this article proposes to estimate the percentage of cadmium in a cocoa sample using the hyperspectral imaging and Machine Learning algorithms, as a non-invasive, non-destructive method that can be implemented in real time. In addition, areas of the spectral signature that contribute the most to the cadmium estimate are identified in order to significantly reduce the number of spectral bands used in the model.

Sentinel-2 is among the spaceborne sensors that tried to meet these requirements. However, due to physical constraints, few visible bands are present with relatively large spectral responses, which limits the leaf pigment content estimation. In this work, we propose to fuse Sentinel-2 bands with a Sentinel-3 image, which has a lower spatial resolution but contains several spectral narrower bands in both the visible and near-infrared (NIR) domains. The fusion procedure consists in sharpening the Sentinel-3 bands to match the Sentinel-2 spatial resolution leading to a higher spatial resolution Sentinel-3 image. The proposed fusion technique follows a physics-based approach based on the use of a radiative transfer model (RTM) for establishing a correspondence between Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images. In greater details, the main spectrally pure constituent of each high-resolution Sentinel-2 pixel is identified for each pixel, and it is then related to the corresponding low-resolution Sentinel-3 pixel. Pure materials are the barycenters of clusters obtained by an unsupervised classification of the Sentinel-2 image. Sentinel-3 signatures are obtained using coarse resolution pixel matching with the Sentinel-2 image. The latter result is then corrected using radiative transfer modeling allowing the production of more realistic signatures. Validation was done using real Sentinel-2/Sentinel-3 images taken with a delay of only one day or less and by comparing the sharpened Sentinel-3 bands Oa04, Oa06, Oa08, and Oa17 with the corresponding Sentinel-2 bands B2, B3, B4, and B8A, as they are, respectively, spectrally close. For all the bands, the rms is lower than 0.007, and compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, it shows competitive results and robustness against scene heterogeneity. Besides, our findings prove that the retrieved Sentinel-3 signatures at full resolution (FR) are physically consistent and in good agreement with the Sentinel-2 data.;1558-0644;;10.1109/TGRS.2023.3257219;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068557;"Dictionary learning;image decomposition;image fusion;radiative transfer";"Spatial resolution;Vegetation mapping;Sensors;Reflectivity;Earth;Satellites;Sensor fusion";"agriculture;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;radiative transfer;regression analysis;remote sensing;vegetation;vegetation mapping";"corresponding Sentinel-2 bands B;high spatial resolution sensors;high-resolution Sentinel-2 pixel;higher resolution vegetation;higher spatial resolution Sentinel-3 image;low-resolution Sentinel-3 pixel;lower spatial resolution;retrieved Sentinel-3 signatures;Sentinel-2 data;Sentinel-2 image;Sentinel-2 spatial resolution;sharpened Sentinel-3 bands Oa;spectral resolution sensors";;;;39;IEEE;14.3.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Early automatic recognition of these diseases will preserve time and enable farmers to act immediately on diseased crops. Machine learning and deep learning techniques offers variety of solutions for detecting rust in diseased crops. However, techniques of explaining such solutions are not common, but are essential because some machine learning models are considered to be as black boxes. In agriculture, the control of potato diseases is important because they lead to crop losses. Therefore, it should be identified and classified as a potato leaf disease to reduce losses. Doing it manually takes time. To solve the problems of mentioned above, an perfect and programmed technique for rapid identification and grouping of disease is desirable. In this study, machine learning and deep learning methods are used to organize potato leaves in two clusters using a present dataset called “Plant Village Dataset”. To classify potato leaves into five groups, namely Potato Late Blight (PLB), Potato Early Blight (PEB) and Potato Healthy (PH) classes, this paper proposes a method based on algorithm of enhanced deep learning. The model is trained using the preexisting “The Plant Village” dataset, which consists of images with two diseases. To analyze the performance of the model, 1964 images of potato leaf disease have been collected from the Kaggle repository, out of which 54 sets of images are selected for training, 6 samples for data validation and 6 samples for testing, belonging to all categories. In the result analysis section, the SVM model performance is calculated at testing phase, and its correctness reached to 99.42%.

The majority of agricultural activities in the nation still use outdated methods, and technical advancement is modest. Effective technology can be applied to this industry to maximise yield and minimise problems. Farmers typically opt to plant crops based on their potential market value and financial returns. Most of the time, farmers are seen to sow the crop based on its market worth and potential financial gains rather than taking into account variables like soil conditions, sustainability, etc. Farmers and the soil's natural ecosystem can suffer as a result, as well.

In everyday life, the tea plant is the most cultivatable plant in the highlands. Most farmers in India have turned to manual labor due to a lack of experience and technological understanding. When plants are infected with a variety of diseases, it has an impact on losses. In tea farming, the most profitable part of the plant is on the top. This leaf is quickly infected by illnesses. Farmers face a difficult task in identifying illnesses in tea plant leaves. Finding diseases in tea plant leaves is a challenge for the farmers. The purpose of this research is to build a CNN model using large datasets. To detect tea plant diseases from images, we developed CNN architecture, including Inception-V3, Googlenet, and Resnet-110.

The satellite images contain enormous data that can be used in various applications. The analysis of the data is a tedious task due to the amount of data and the heterogeneity of the data. Thus, in this paper, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained using Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm (MRFO) is proposed. RBFNN is a three-layer network comprising of input, output, and hidden layers that can process large amounts. The trained network can discover hidden data patterns in unseen data. The learning algorithm and seed selection play a vital role in the performance of the network. The seed selection is done using the spectral indices to further improve the performance of the network. The manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is inspired by the intelligent behaviour of manta rays. It emulates three unique foraging behaviours namelys chain, cyclone, and somersault foraging. The satellite images contain enormous amount of data and thus require exploration in large search space. The spiral movement of the MRFO algorithm enables it to explore large search spaces effectively. The proposed method is applied on pre and post flooding Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of New Brunswick area. The method was applied to identify and classify the land cover changes in the area induced by flooding. The images are classified using the proposed method and a change map is developed using post classification comparison. The change map shows that a large amount of agricultural area was washed away due to flooding. The measurement of the affected area in square kilometres is also performed for mitigation activities. The results show that post flooding the area covered by water is increased whereas the vegetated area is decreased.

The proposed system consists of three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. To increase the quality of the input image, the pre-processing stage includes image scaling, normalisation, and enhancement. A deep convolutional neural network is used in the feature extraction stage to extract useful features from the pre-processed image. Finally, a softmax classifier is used in the classification stage to categorise the retrieved features into several types of coconut tree diseases. The suggested system is tested using a publically accessible dataset of coconut tree disease photos, and the experimental findings show that the proposed system is effective and efficient at accurately recognising the diseases that harm coconut plants.

Variances in the lighting conditions, position, and stages of disease symptoms usually lead to degradation of classification accuracy. Knowledge distillation is a popular method to improve the model performance to deal with the indistinguishable image classification problem. It aims to have a well-optimised small student network guided by a large teacher network. Existing knowledge distillation methods mainly consider training a teacher network that needs a high storage space and considerable computing resources. Self-knowledge distillation methods have been proposed to distil knowledge from the same network. Although self-knowledge distillation saves time and space compared with knowledge distillation, it only learns label knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel self-distillation method to recognize the fine-grained plant category, which considers holistic knowledge based on the Squeeze and Excitation Network. We label this new method as holistic self-distillation because it captures knowledge through spatial features and labels.

On the other hand, there is evidence that small-scale farmers face several challenges, such as lack of access to market information, poor soil quality, and inadequate farming techniques. ML technology can be used to provide real-time information on weather patterns, soil quality, and other factors that affect crop growth and yields. By providing this information, ML can help farmers choose the right crops to plant and optimize their yields. In this paper, the authors report on the use of AI to select the appropriate crop to plant, which resulted in crop choices that are 99% accurate. This was achieved by collecting climatic and edaphic data, and using different multi-class classification algorithms to train the dataset. The results of the different algorithms were compared and contrasted using different metrics to determine the best fit for the development a framework for prediction of crop suitability at pre-planting stage.

Crop mapping during the growing season is particularly critical in timely monitoring of the agricultural system. Most existing studies focusing on within-season crop mapping leverage historical remote sensing and crop type reference data for model building, due to the difficulty in obtaining timely crop type samples for the current growing season. Yet the crop type samples from previous years may not be used directly considering the diverse patterns of crop phenology across years and locations, which hampers the scalability and transferability of the model to the current season for timely crop mapping. This article proposes an innovative within-season emergence (WISE) phenology normalized deep learning model towards scalable within-season crop mapping. The crop time-series remote sensing data are first normalized by the WISE crop emergence dates before being fed into an attention-based one-dimensional convolutional neural network classifier. Compared to conventional calendar-based approaches, the WISE-phenology normalization approach substantially helps the deep learning crop mapping model accommodate the spatiotemporal variations in crop phenological dynamics. Results in Illinois from 2017 to 2020 indicate that the proposed model outperforms calendar-based approaches and yields over 90% overall accuracy for classifying corn and soybeans at the end of season. During the growing season, the proposed model can give satisfactory performance (85% overall accuracy) one to four weeks earlier than calendar-based approaches. With WISE-phenology normalization, the proposed model exhibits more stable performance across Illinois and can be transferred to different years with enhanced scalability and robustness.;2151-1535;;10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3237500;"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2048068); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:80NSSC21K0946); U.S. Department of Agriculture(grant numbers:2021-67021-33446); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018297;"Agriculture;crop mapping;crop phenology;deep learning;remote sensing;time series analysis";"Crops;Data models;Remote sensing;MODIS;Deep learning;Market research;Time series analysis";"agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;time series;vegetation mapping";"calendar-based approaches;crop phenological dynamics;crop phenology;crop time-series remote sensing data;crop type reference data;crop-type mapping;current growing season;current season;deep learning crop mapping model;timely crop mapping;timely crop type samples;timely monitoring;towards scalable within-season crop mapping;WISE crop emergence dates;WISE-phenology normalization approach;within-season crop mapping leverage historical remote sensing;within-season emergence phenology normalized deep learning model";;2;;52;CCBY;16.1.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Many people are now working on ways to locate indoor things to interact and exchange data between smart things and web services and apps, which is called “WoT,” or “Web of Things.” To interact and exchange the data, researchers need a search engine on WoT.

In this research, we propose a novel approach to index indoor things in the WoT by leveraging machine learning and web technologies. Our approach includes a data preprocessing step, where we extract relevant features from the sensor data, followed by a clustering algorithm to group similar devices. We then use a semantic model to assign meaning to the clusters and develop a search engine to enable efficient searching of indoor things.

In this context, along with the increase in the volume of data available, the availability of ground-truth (GT) data to train supervised models, which is usually time-consuming and costly, may even be more critical. In this scenario, the possibility to transfer a model learned on a particular time span (source domain) to a different period of time (target domain), over the same geographical area, can be advantageous in terms of both cost and time efforts. However, such model transfer is challenging due to different climate, weather, or environmental conditions affecting remote sensing data collected at different time periods, resulting in possible distribution shifts between the source and target domains. With the aim to cope with the multisensor temporal transfer scenario in the context of land cover mapping, where multitemporal and multiscale information are used jointly, we propose a Multisensor, Multitemporal, and Multiscale SPatially Aware Domain Adaptation (M3SPADA) framework, a deep learning methodology that jointly exploits self-training and adversarial learning to transfer a multisensor land cover classifier (MSLCC) from a time period (year) to a different one on the same geographical area.

The population of the world is increasing daily, making it crucial to produce sufficient food to sustain such a large populace. However, as time goes by, various plant diseases infect the crops, causing a negative impact on agricultural plant productivity. A country additionally needs to accomplish agricultural productivity of fundamental agricultural products to ensure the well-being of its residents because Many countries’ economies are greatly reliant on the cultivation of crops and livestock for commercial purposes. One industry that significantly affects human existence and economic condition is agriculture. Agriculture-related items are lost because of poor management. Diseases are very injurious to the condition of the plant’s overall health, which will have an influence on its growth. It is crucial to keep track of the development of agricultural plants to ensure the slightest loss. Plant disorders may be identified spontaneously, that can assist farmers manage their crops more efficiently and increase production. An imprecise diagnosis of plant diseases can lead to substantial losses in production, time, expenses, and product quality. To ensure successful cultivation, it is necessary to monitor the plant’s condition at every stage of growth. Employing an automated technique for detecting plant diseases has several advantages, such as decreasing the amount of labor needed to oversee vast crop farms and recognizing disease indications at a very early stage, such as when it initially appear on plant leaves. Various Machine learning and Deep Learning techniques have been studied and presented in this research work.

This can enable farmers to improve yield to produce more food, feed, and fiber. Current breeding practices involve extracting leaf parameters on a small subset of the leaves present in the breeding plots, while still requiring substantial manual labor. To automate this process, an important step is the precise distinction between separate leaves, which is the problem we address in this letter. We exploit recent advancements in 3D deep learning to build a convolutional neural network that learns to segment individual leaves. As done in current breeding practices, we select a subset of leaves to be used for phenotypic trait evaluation as this allows us to alleviate the influence of segmentation errors on the phenotypic trait estimation. To this extent we propose to use an additional neural network to predict the quality of each segmented leaf and discard inaccurate leaf instances. The experiments show that our network yields higher segmentation accuracy on sugar beet breeding plots planted under the supervision of the German Federal Office for Plant Varieties.

However, directly predicting pixel-level labels for each facial component over the whole face image would obtain limited accuracy, especially for tiny facial components. To address this problem, some recent works propose to first crop tiny patches from the whole face image and then predict masks for each facial component. However, such cropping-and-segmenting strategy consists of two independent stages, which cannot be jointly optimized. Besides, as one valuable piece of information for parsing the highly structured facial components, context cues are not elaborately explored by the existing works. To address these issues, we propose a component-level refinement network (CLRNet) for precisely segmenting out each facial component. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism to bridge the two independent stages together and form an end-to-end trainable pipeline for face parsing. Furthermore, we incorporate the global context information into the refining process for each cropped facial component patch, providing informative cues for accurate parsing.

Real-time object recognition is an important technique in smart cities, in which low-cost network deployment and low-latency data transfer are key technologies. In this study, we focus on time- and wavelength-division multiplexed passive optical network (TWDM-PON)-based inference systems to deploy cost-efficient networks that accommodate several network cameras. A significant issue for a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based inference system via a TWDM-PON is the optimal allocation of the upstream wavelength and bandwidth to enable real-time inference. However, an increase in the batch size of the arrival data at the edge servers, thereby ensuring low-latency transmission, has not been considered previously. Therefore, this study proposes the concept of an inference system in which a large number of cameras periodically upload image data to a GPU-based server via the TWDM-PON. Moreover, we propose a cooperative wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithm to ensure low-latency and time-synchronized data arrivals at the edge.

However, cassava leaf diseases pose a significant risk to the yield and productivity of the crop. In this study, To proposed a privacy-protecting federated learning CNN model for classifying cassava leaf disease severity levels. The model was trained on 9,675 images representing four severity levels: normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Using federated learning, the model enabled multiple farms or organizations to train the model collaboratively using their respective datasets without sharing raw images, thereby addressing data privacy concerns and enhancing the model's generalizability. The federated learning CNN model obtained an overall accuracy of 0.95 and an F1-score of 0.91875, indicating a lively performance in classifying cassava leaf diseases with varying degrees of severity. The model demonstrated exceptionally high precision and recall rates for the healthy and severe classes while revealing room for development in differentiating between the mild and moderate severity levels. Compared to traditional CNN models and other machine learning methods, the federated learning CNN model demonstrated competitive performance, addressing data privacy concerns and benefiting from diverse data sources.

Accurately measuring the severity of a disease is vital because it allows farmers to use the appropriate amount and kind of pesticides on the crops that are threatened. Incorrect estimates of disease severity in plants can lead to wasteful or ineffective use of pesticides, making it a difficult assignment even for researchers and plant pathologists. Recently, there has been a rapid rise in the application of machine vision and deep learning methods to smart farming. To guarantee food security, we need to raise output and improve crop quality, but doing so requires a more precise and innovative method of assessing the severity of the crop disease.

The categorization of six common guava leaf diseases is the main emphasis of the research, which makes use of four different client datasets. Large-scale dataset management and use for illness diagnosis present considerable hurdles in the age of big data. Federated learning, a technique that enables model training across several decentralized clients while maintaining data privacy, is how our approach tackles these problems. The model was individually trained for each client using local data, and the model parameters were then combined to create a global model via federated averaging.

However, this industry faces substantial financial setbacks when contagious diseases transmit among their livestock. One of the most common and expensive diseases affecting the livestock industry is Bovine Mastitis. This paper presents a real-time system for detecting bovine mastitis in livestock using deep learning (dl) and machine learning (ml) techniques. The system aims to provide a timely and accurate diagnosis of mastitis, ultimately reducing costs and improving the efficiency of treatment. By utilizing dl and ml techniques, the system is able to analyze data collected from edge devices and make accurate predictions about the presence of mastitis. The dataset that has been used for the classification contains both an Image dataset consisting of 1341 images and a Numerical dataset that had been taken from 1100 cows over a period of six days. The edge device utilizes sensors and cameras to collect data from the cow, which is then processed through ml and dl algorithms using Raspberry Pi and cloud computing respectively, and then displays if the cow is infected with mastitis or not. Inception V3 and RandomForest algorithms were used for dl and ml, respectively, and had an accuracy of 99.34% and 99% respectively.

Traditional inspection across different plant fields is time-consuming and impractical for a wider plantation size, thus reducing crop production. Therefore, many smart agricultural practices are deployed to control plant diseases and pests. Most of these approaches, for example, use vision-based artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or deep learning (DL) methods and models to provide disease detection solutions. However, existing open issues must be considered and addressed before AI methods can be used. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) and present a detailed survey of the studies employing data collection techniques and publicly available datasets. To begin the review, 1349 papers were chosen from five major academic databases, namely Springer, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ACM library. After deploying a comprehensive screening process, the review considered 176 final studies based on the importance of the method. Several crops, including grapes, rice, apples, cucumbers, maize, tomatoes, wheat, and potatoes, have tested mainly on the hyperspectral imagery and vision-centered approaches. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic regression (LR) classifiers demonstrated an increased accuracy in experiments compared to traditional classifiers. Besides the image taxonomy, disease localization is depicted in these approaches as a bottle neck to disease detection.

Real-time and accurate access to farmland information and crop growth dynamics is a prerequisite for the implementation of precision agriculture. Machine learning identifies existing knowledge to acquire new knowledge, promotes the development of Artificial Intelligence, and brings a large number of data training sets for machine learning. This article aims to ensure the safe operation of agricultural information systems and guarantee the data security of intelligent agriculture. The machine learning method explores the wireless network deployment of the UAV system. The geographical location deployment of agricultural information security can effectively carry out rapid security detection of agricultural information security. First, the UAV-assisted information acquisition system was studied. Besides, a double deep  $Q$ -network (DDQN) algorithm for location deployment based on geography position information (GPI) was proposed to quickly optimize the deployment location of UAVs. GPI can avoid the complicated calculation process of channel state information. The DDQN algorithm was introduced to obtain the functional relationship between the GPI and the optimal UAV deployment position, forming a new GPI-Learning strategy. In addition, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are integrated as the CNN–LSTM algorithm to build the intrusion detection system for Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) for agriculture. In the integrated network structure of the system, LSTM is responsible for data transmission, and CNN is capable of network model building. Combined with the influence of various parameters on the performance of the UAV deployment location algorithm, the simulation experiment set the population size as 36, the discovery probability as 0.25, the step scaling factor as 0.8, and the Levy flight index as 1.25.

Thus, we utilize these U-shaped furrows as a mean to automatically navigate the mobile robot. To achieve this goal, the RGB-Depth camera is used to create 3D cloud point data of the furrows. We develop a method for determining the slopes of the bed form using the cloud point data to identify the exact position of the furrows so that the mobile robot can autonomously navigate through the entire row of each furrow without stepping into the bed form.

This method requires time and human-resources depending on the scale of the greenhouses. However, the measured data are sometimes inaccurate and leads to wrong activities, such as irrigation, which may make negative effects on plants, soils and increase unnecessary resource expenses. Fortunately, in the recent years, different modern technologies have been applied to agricultural sphere and implemented smart monitoring, smart irrigation and other hi-tech systems. However, it is still a major challenge to achieve better energy efficiency and reduce the cost of monitoring real-time parameters in high quality. In this research work, we developed and implemented a wireless sensor network (WSN) based monitoring system for specifically greenhouses and focused on solving the two main issues: longer life-longevity of WSN devices and lower the system cost. In order to achieve the longer life-longevity of wireless devices we developed specific WSN devices consisting of the most low-power consuming electronic components. Besides, an operational algorithm and measurement method has been developed. On the purpose of decreasing the hardware material costs, we did choose the most optimal priced electronic components. WSN sensor nodes make measurements of four parameters, soil moisture level, soil temperature, air humidity and temperature. The measured data is sent to coordinator node which forwards each received data packets to web platform of the system.

Whereas, when tractors work in the Tele-driving (or Remote driving) mode, the operators are prone to fatigue because they need to concentrate for long periods of time. In response to these, a dual-mode control strategy was proposed to integrate the advantages of both approaches, i.e., by combing Self-driving at most of the time with Tele-driving under special (complex and hazardous) conditions through switching control method. First, the state switcher was proposed, which is used for smooth switching the driving modes according to different working states of a tractor. Then, the state switching control law and the corresponding subsystem tracking controllers were designed. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the dual-mode control method were evaluated via actual experimental testing of a tractor whose results show that the proposed control method can switch smoothly, stably, and efficiently between the two driving modes automatically. The average control accuracy has been improved by 20% and 15% respectively, compared to the conventional Tele-driving control and Self-driving control with low-precision navigation. In conclusion, the proposed dual-mode control method can not only satisfy the operation in the complex and changeable farmland environment, but also free drivers from high-intensity and fatiguing work.

This study collected images of seven common apple leaf disease categories and one healthy category to address the present needs of various complex disease recognition scenarios. The disease images not only contain the common laboratory background but also add the background of the field growth environment of apple trees. And different recognition scenarios are further enriched by image enhancement techniques. For the model part, the processing of spatial feature information was strengthened while focusing on the channel feature information to ensure that the model focuses more on the subtle disease spot information for different disease classifications.

To achieve this goal, researchers have proposed many deep learning models to help farmers detect diseases in their crops as efficiently as possible to avoid yield declines. These models are usually trained on personal or public plant disease datasets such as PlantVillage or PlantDoc. PlantVillage is composed of laboratory images captured under laboratory conditions, with one leaf each and a uniform background. The models trained on this dataset have very low accuracies when running on field images with complex backgrounds and multiple leaves per image. To solve this problem, PlantDoc was built using 2,569 field images downloaded from the Internet and annotated to identify the individual leaves. However, this dataset includes some laboratory images and the absence of plant pathologists during the annotation process may have resulted in misclassification. In this study, FieldPlant is suggested as a dataset that includes 5,170 plant disease images collected directly from plantations. Manual annotation of individual leaves on each image was performed under the supervision of plant pathologists to ensure process quality. This resulted in 8,629 individual annotated leaves across the 27 disease classes.

A comprehensive assessment of these LST products is essential for their subsequent applications (APPs) in energy, water, and carbon cycle modeling. In this study, an evaluation of these three Landsat LST products was performed using in situ LST measurements from five networks [surface radiation budget (SURFRAD), atmospheric radiation measurement (ARM), Heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research (HiWATER), baseline surface radiation network (BSRN), and National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)] for the period of 2009–2019. Results reveal that the overall accuracies of CUG LST with bias [root-mean-square error (RMSE)] of 0.54 K (2.19 K) and IPMA LST with bias (RMSE) of 0.59 K (2.34 K) are marginally superior to USGS LST with bias (RMSE) of 0.96 K (2.51 K). The RMSE of USGS LST is about 0.3 K less than IPMA/CUG LST at water surface sites and is about 0.4 K higher than IPMA/CUG LST at cropland and shrubland sites. As for tundra, grassland, and forest sites, the RMSEs of three Landsat LST products are similar, and the RMSE difference among three Landsat LST products is < 0.18 K. Considering the close emissivity estimates over water surface in these three LST data, USGS LST has a better performance in atmospheric correction over water surface compared with IPMA/CUG LST. For land surface sites, the RMSE of LST increases initially and then decreases with land surface emissivity (LSE) for three Landsat LST products. This indicates that the emissivity correction has a large uncertainty for moderately vegetated surface with emissivity ranging from 0.970 to 0.980. Underestimated emissivity for USGS LST at vegetated sites leads to overestimation of LST, which could have led to the higher bias and RMSE compared with IPMA/CUG LST. For the LST retrievals for the three different sensors [i.e., Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS)] onboard the Landsat satellite series, the accuracies are consistent and comparable, which is beneficial for providing long-term and coherent LST.;1558-0644;;10.1109/TGRS.2022.3232624;"Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2022LDE001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801443,41801348); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005114;"Land surface temperature (LST);Landsat;single-channel algorithm;validation of satellite retrieval";"Remote sensing;Earth;Artificial satellites;Land surface temperature;Land surface;Atmospheric modeling;Mathematical models";"atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;hydrological techniques;land surface temperature;remote sensing;vegetation";"atmospheric radiation measurement;baseline surface radiation network;China University of Geosciences;CUG LST;Heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research;HiWATER;Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera;IPMA LST;land surface emissivity;land surface sites;Landsat LST products;Landsat series;long-term land surface temperature products;LST data;LST measurements;LST retrievals;US Geological Survey LST;USGS LST;vegetated sites;water surface sites";;;;86;IEEE;3.1.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Farmers around the world face a constant challenge in trying to keep up with the rising demand for food crops in the face of fluctuating climates and an alarming rise in population. One of the most widely grown cereals, wheat supplies a significant portion of the world's main food supply. This heat-sensitive crop is being severely harmed by the unusual rise in environmental temperature and decrease in the amount of rainfall. Scientists from all around the world have been looking at what are called Climate Sustainable Agriculture Practices in an effort to boost wheat crop yields while reducing the impact on the environment. Predicting crop yields before harvest can assist scientists and farmers evaluate risks and implement preventative actions to maintain a consistent agricultural harvest. There are two main types of models used to predict harvest yields: crop growth models and data-driven models. The time, money, and accuracy costs associated with using crop growth models to predict crop yields stem from the fact that these methods are sensitive to environmental variables. So, the farmer can't do anything in the nick of time to boost his crop's production. With the advent of machine learning algorithms, data-driven models have become even more effective at a fraction of the cost of traditional empirical models. Machine learning and Machine learning have come a long way, but they haven't been completely used for precise crop output forecasting. With this study, the authors want to provide a reliable method for estimating future wheat harvests in one of India's Punjab provinces. For precise and timely wheat crop yield prediction, an KNN with DT hybrid Machine learning model is proposed. To further improve the model's performance, the researchers used a genetic algorithm to tune the KNN-two DT's most crucial hyper parameters: the size of its window and the number of neurons in its hidden layer. This study has also examined the impact of environmental factors on agricultural yield in order to isolate the most important environmental parameters for future regulation and monitoring in order to more accurately predict crop yield. The proposed model for predicting wheat crop yield was tested with a battery of trials. The effectiveness of the suggested model was validated through a comparative comparison with state-of-the-art approaches for yield prediction. Farmers, policymakers, and planners can all benefit greatly from the proposed study by improving their ability to make informed decisions and take corrective and preventative action to boost agricultural yields.;2473-7577;979-8-3503-4821-7;10.1109/ICCCI56745.2023.10128446;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128446;"Crop;Prediction;Machine learning;KNN;DT (Decision Tree)";"Machine learning algorithms;Biological system modeling;Crops;Machine learning;Predictive models;Agriculture;Environmental factors";"agriculture;crops;environmental factors;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)";"agricultural yield;alarming rise;Climate Sustainable Agriculture Practices;consistent agricultural harvest;crop growth models;data-driven models;DT hybrid Machine learning model;environmental temperature;farmer;food crops;future wheat harvests;harvest yields;heat-sensitive crop;KNN-two DT's most crucial hyper parameters;machine learning algorithms;main food supply;precise crop output forecasting;precise wheat crop yield prediction;predicting crop yields;timely wheat crop yield prediction;traditional empirical models;unusual rise;wheat supplies;world face";;;;16;IEEE;24.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The presented SBODL-FCC technique exploits DL models with hyperparameter optimizers for food crop classification on UAV images. To accomplish this, the presented SBODL-FCC technique employs adaptive bilateral filtering technique for image preprocessing. Besides, the SBODL-FCC technique uses MobileNetv2 feature extractor with Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm for parameter optimization. Moreover, the food crop classification process is performed through convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model.

The main challenge for crop line detection in paddy fields is to overcome challenges from a semi-constrained environment. It means that the surroundings of the paddy field are variable and exist many distractions. In a typical paddy field, UGVs may encounter brightness variation, surface reflection, and irregular crop seedling placement which can cause row detection inaccuracy. We hope to use the powerful deep learning technique to overcome environmental distractions that can affect the accuracy of crop line detection. Inspired by similar lane detection task for auto driving in semiconstrained environments. This article proposed a crop line detection model based on the row selection method and auxiliary learning technique. Unlike previous works regarding crop line detection as a semantic segmentation task or object detection task, using the row selection method can directly distinguish each line in the field and result in a lower computational cost. As there is no publicly available large-scale dataset for crop line detection in the paddy field, this work also makes a small dataset containing crop line in various growing conditions and propose an offline data argumentation called LineMix.

In this study, we aimed to develop an image analysis-based method to automatically quantify the number of grains in a quicker manner.

This can be done using a variety of approaches including visual inspection, laboratory tests, computer vision techniques etc. Plant leaf diseases must be detected and categorize the cause in order to take corresponding counter measures to manage and control them for healthy and achieve high-yielding crops. In this contemporary Deep Learning era traditional object detection methods have become obsolete due to limitations such as the need for manual crafted features, lack of robustness, and inability to handle large datasets. Deep learning-based approaches are more robust, can account for differences in brightness, interference, and perspective, and can automatically learn features from enormous datasets. These techniques are practical because they can efficiently process large datasets in a brief time frame. Several research studies have developed expert and automatic disease detection methods. Most of this research are limited to one or two plant species and a few disease types.

Each client in the research had a local dataset of red globe grapes leaf diseases, and the study deployed a federated learning model across the four clients. The clients updated the global model collectively after individually training CNN models on their local data and sharing model updates with a central server while maintaining data privacy. The model's professional capacity to recognize and categorise illness states across clients with high reliability was shown by experimental outcomes assessed through Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Support, and Accuracy, supporting the effectiveness of federated learning.

In comparison to other vegetables, leafy greens have yet to garner as much attention as other crops that this study's large-scale analysis comes up with, particularly when categorizing readily available leafy vegetables and identifying the affected area and whether they are affected or not. Plant diseases can cause substantial losses in agricultural productivity, and many researchers are working to address the difficulties farmers encounter in identifying and treating these conditions while diagnosing their diseases. The purpose of this study is to develop a dependable and effective approach for classifying seven varieties of leafy vegetables and detecting seven types of plant diseases precisely in Bangladesh using machine learning and deep learning CNN models. To this end, this paper analyzed and provided solutions using a total of eight models: five classification models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, YOLOv5, and YOLOv8) and three instance segmentation models (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8). Two distinct datasets, “LeafyVclassify7BD” with 3306 images and “LeafyVdisease7BD” with 4493 images, were developed to classify leaves, segment the diseased area, and classify and detect damaged leaves.

This paper presents a novel unsupervised feature selection method, referred to as Multi-Group Adaptive Graph Representation (MGAGR). Different from existing methods, the relationship between features is explored via the global similarity matrix, which is reconstructed by local similarities of multiple groups. Specifically, the similarity of a feature compared to other features can be represented by the linear combination of all the local similarities. The local similarity of a representative group is given a large weight to reconstruct the global similarity. Besides, an iterative algorithm is given to solve the optimization problem, in which the global similarity matrix, its corresponding reconstruction weights and the self-representation matrix are iteratively improved. Experimental results on 8 benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods in terms of clustering performance.

However, wheat yield is highly affected by stripe rust, which is considered the most devastating fungal disease, causing 5.5 million tonnes of loss per year globally. In order to minimize this loss, the accurate and timely detection of rust disease is crucial instead of manual inspection. Towards this end, we propose a system to detect wheat rust disease and classify its infection types into four classes, including healthy, resistant, moderate (moderately resistant to moderately susceptible), and susceptible. The wheat rust dataset is collected indigenously from the National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad. A pre-trained U2 Net model is used to remove the background and extract the leaf containing the rust disease. Subsequently, two deep learning classifiers, including the Xception model and ResNet-50 are applied to classify the stripe rust severity levels, where the ResNet-50 model outperformed with the highest accuracy of 96%. This research presents a comparison between two state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, memory utilization, and prediction time, which will assist the research community in selecting the most appropriate model for plant disease detection. Moreover, to assess the external validity, the performance of these classifiers is compared with the existing technique using a publicly available dataset, which confirms the validity of the results. Additionally, an intelligent edge computing rust detection device has been developed, where the trained ResNet-50 model is deployed, which facilitates the farmers to monitor the rust attack.

Unfortunately, the prevalence of crop diseases is increasing day by day, leading to significant financial losses. Similarly, rice leaf disease is a prevalent issue that impacts the growth and productivity of rice plants. It is triggered by various pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and can take various forms, including leaf blights, spots, and wilts. To diagnose this disease, it is crucial to inspect the leaves of the rice plant, which may exhibit discolouration, deformities, or lesions. The rice leaf disease can cause a decrease in the quality and quantity of the crop. To mitigate this issue, early detection and accurate identification of diseases and pests in rice plants are necessary.

Crop yield prediction is used to estimate the potential harvest of crops, providing valuable information to farmers, policymakers, and agribusinesses for planning, resource management, and making informed crop production decisions. It helps to improve food security, reduce food waste, and increase the efficiency of food production. Gradient Boosting Agricultural Yield Prediction is a machine learning approach that employs decision trees and gradient descent optimization to create accurate crop yield predictions. This approach and strategy are useful in predicting crop yields. They can assist farmers and agricultural organizations in making better-educated planting, harvesting, and resource allocation decisions. The results of crop yield prediction based on gradient boosting with an accuracy rate of 87.2%, precision of0.84, recall ofO.90, and F1-Score of0.87 indicate that the model is making accurate predictions about crop yields with a good balance of precision and recall. Our work suggests that the model performs efficiently and makes accurate predictions for crop yields. It increases crop production prediction, which improves decision-making, increases efficiency, effectively allocates resources, supports planning, and reduces agriculture’s environmental impact. It has a tremendous impact on the agriculture sector because it promotes sustainability, reduces waste, and improves overall performance.;;979-8-3503-3600-9;10.1109/ICNWC57852.2023.10127269;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127269;"Agriculture;Gradient Boosting;Crop yield prediction;Food Production;Food security;crop yield forecasting";"Crops;Production;Organizations;Predictive models;Boosting;Prediction algorithms;Planning";"agriculture;crops;decision making;decision trees;food products;food security;food waste;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation";"accurate crop yield predictions;agricultural organizations;agricultural outcomes;agriculture;crop production forecasting;crop production prediction;crop yields;decision-making;effective crop Yield Prediction;farmers;food production;food security;food shortages;food waste;Gradient Boosting Agricultural Yield Prediction;gradient descent optimization;inefficient resource allocation;informed crop production decisions;lower farmer profitability;machine-learning algorithm forecasting yield;resource allocation decisions";;;;16;IEEE;25.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

With the increasing population, it has become necessary to yield enough amount of crops to satiate their hunger. In the mean while we face a lot of problems while considering the needs of such a huge population. Lots of crops gets destroyed which affects the overall yield of the crops, hence leading to shortage of food. We know that it is very common for plants to get affected by diseases. Some of the factors are fertilizers and pesticides, cultural practices, environmental and surrounding conditions etc. These diseases affect overall yield as well as the economy based on it. Any approach to overcome this problem would help the farmers to cultivate crops efficiently. Hence, detection of disease in crops plays a vital role in agriculture. The proposed manuscript aims for the detection of crop diseases by using classification algorithm in deep learning concept.

While many areas of agriculture are leveraging cutting-edge technological innovations, farming remains far behind in adopting these advancements. Ayurvedic medicine and other plant-based medical systems employ the classification of plants by their leaflets for a variety of purposes, including ecosystem, farming, disease diagnosis, rare plant maintenance, and Herbal remedies. Due to the utilization of biological nomenclature, standard methods of plant recognition and classification are difficult, time-consuming, and aggravating for non-experts. For learners who are seeking to learn about species, this poses a real challenge. Based on this consequence, this paper recommends Conv2D Xception Adadelta Gradient Descent (CXAGD) Deep Learning to classify the plant species based on the leaflet feature structure. The proposed CXAGD model uses Leaf classification dataset from KAGGLE with 4500 plant leaflets of various species. One input, a dense average pooling layer, and an output layer were used in the development of the proposed Conv2D Adadelta Gradient Deep CNN model. The CXAGD model was constructed using 36 depth wise separable convolutional layers and a maximum pooling layer for each convolution and trained with learning rate of Adadelta optimizer. The CXAGD built with Xception network with the Adadelta optimizer with the dropout of 0.5, weight decay of L2 regularization. The leaf dataset subjected to the training and testing data division and the training data applied to CXAGD model and also applied to other CNN models for comparing the efficiency of the proposed CXAGD model. Python was used for programming, with a batch size of 64 and 30 training epochs, on a Geforce Tesla V100 Graphics card server. Implementation outcomes projects that proposed CXAGD model exhibits accuracy of 97.85%, Precision of 97.42%, Recall of 97.75% and FScore of 97.76% when compared with existing CNN models.;;978-1-6654-9400-7;10.1109/ICAECT57570.2023.10117710;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10117710;"Convolution;CNN;deep learning;pooling;accuracy";"Deep learning;Training;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Power capacitors";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;gradient methods;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;Python";"36 depth wise separable convolutional layers;4500 plant leaflets;Adadelta optimizer;Conv2D Adadelta Gradient Deep CNN model;Conv2D Xception Adadelta Gradient Descent Deep;Conv2D Xception Adadelta Gradient Descent Learning rate Deep learning optimizer;cutting-edge technological innovations;CXAGD model exhibits accuracy;dense average pooling layer;existing CNN models;farming remains;Leaf classification dataset;leaflet feature structure;maximum pooling layer;plant recognition;plant species classification;plant-based medical systems;rare plant maintenance;technological advances";;;;11;IEEE;15.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Pheno-parenting, a new concept, derives certain methodologies from plant phenotyping, which monitors plants at various stages of their life cycle and supports their growth by deploying modern tools and technologies. In this work, a small-scale hydroponic system was set up for plant life cycle image data collection and analysis, which consists of thirty plants of three species (i.e., petunia, pansy, and calendula), with ten plants of each species grown. A Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based approach has been adopted to analyse key tasks such as plant species recognition, growth analysis, health analysis, and yield stage identification. Calendula plants have been correctly recognised with above 95% detection accuracy in all test cases. The result thus obtained indicates that side-view images are more effective at identifying species and tracking growth. On the other hand, top-view photographs do a better job of capturing the texture and colour characteristics of leaves and budding flowers.

Currently, this is formulated as an automatic disease segmentation task addressed via deep learning frameworks. These deep leaning frameworks trained with leaf image data in a supervised paradigm have few limitations, mainly: (1) training datasets are heavily imbalanced towards healthy leaf images, (2) disease region annotation is labour-intensive and (3) due to the heterogeneity of disease symptoms, these frameworks lacks generalisability. In this paper, we reformulate disease segmentation as an anomaly localisation task. Specifically, we introduce a novel unsupervised framework (AnoLeaf) based on an edge-guided in-painting that optimises the learning of contextual attention on only healthy leaf images. The network utilisation on diseased leaf images results in reconstruction of its healthy counterparts, generating an inpainting error. The contextual attention maps reinforce the inpainting error to effectively localise the disease. Thus, AnoLeaf alleviates the acquisition and annotation of rare disease images.

Most existing methods employ low-level spatial or sequential information to reconstruct the rain-free background image. However, due to the lack of sufficiently capturing long-term contextual relation between pixels, these methods often lead to incompletely modeling rain patterns and visible rain residues remained. In this paper, we propose a novel Degradation-Aware Transformer (DAT), which leverages a multi-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative degradation representations by a degradation-aware model.

Benefiting from the developed self-attention mechanism, DAT is able to capture long-term relations between pixels as well as completely modeling the rain degradation patterns.

Besides, two theoretical analyses are given to prove the interpretability of the proposed graph structures, which can further describe the relationships between samples to samples in single-domain and cross-domain transfer feature learning scenarios. Moreover, we adopt novel weight strategies via probability information to generate robust centroids in each proposed item to enhance the accuracy of transfer feature learning and reduce the error accumulation.

Passive microwave (PMW) is one of the primary techniques for obtaining spatially continuous LST at regional, continental, and global scales. However, there is an orbital gap in the LST retrieved from PMW (PMW LST) due to the scanning scheme of the PMW sensor, which limits the application of PMW LST, so it is necessary for the proposed some methods to fill the orbital gap of PMW LST. In this study, a new orbital gap-filling method based on a deep neural network (DNN) was developed to address the issue of PMW LST orbital gaps. This method first established the DNN model based on the nonlinear relationship between AMSR2 LST and 11 environmental variables and then used the DNN model to generate a new spatially continuous LST product, namely, DNN-LST, and, finally, used DNN-LST to fill the orbital gaps of AMSR2 LST to generate the daytime/nighttime spatially seamless gap-filled LST (GF-LST) product for China from 2012 to 2020. GF-LST can more correctly represent the spatiotemporal variation of surface temperature in China than AMSR2 LST because it has continuous spatial texture information and no obvious boundary reconstruction effect. After verifying the accuracy of GF-LST products through simulated gap region validation and in situ validation, it can be found that: 1) DNN-LST in simulated gap regions showed high accuracy during the daytime and nighttime on July 15, 2012–2020, and the mean values of bias and root mean square error (RMSE) compared with AMSR2 LST at day (night) were, respectively, ?0.08 K (?0.22 K) and 1.89 K (2.23 K); 2) the accuracy of DNN-LST was the best in autumn (mean RMSE values of 1.43 K at day and 1.89 K at night) and the worst in winter (mean RMSE values of 2.35 K at day and 2.36 K at night), no matter during daytime or nighttime, in different seasons in 2015–2017; 3) the RMSE value of DNN-LST during nighttime was slightly higher than the RMSE value of DNN-LST during daytime; and 4) the accuracy of DNN-LST was equivalent to AMSR2 LST, that is, the unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) of DNN-LST and AMSR2 LST was all about 4 K compared with in situ LST, but the ubRMSE of DNN-LST was slightly lower than AMSR2 LST. The above accuracy validation analysis shows that DNN-LST has good robustness and good spatial consistency with AMSR2 LST and can be well used to fill the orbital gap of AMSR2 LST to generate spatial seamless GF-LST product.";1558-0644;;10.1109/TGRS.2023.3247806;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41871275,42171362); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10050143;"AMSR2;deep neural network (DNN);gap filling;land surface temperature (LST);passive microwave (PMW)";"Land surface temperature;Orbits;Land surface;Filling;Deep learning;Atmospheric modeling;Temperature distribution";"atmospheric temperature;deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysics computing;land surface temperature;remote sensing";"AD 2012 to 2020;AMSR2 LST;autumn season;China;deep neural network;DNN;DNN-LST;land-atmosphere system;passive microwave;PMW LST orbital gaps;spatial-seamless AMSR2 land surface temperature;spatial-seamless GF-LST product";;3;;62;IEEE;22.2.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Due to SFC requests’ life-cycle and resource adjustment, the distribution of the remaining physical resources may become unbalanced, which brings negative effects to subsequent SFC requests as well as network operators. In this paper, we investigate the network SFC migration problem in the core cloud under the premise of considering the migration cost and the balance of physical resource distribution. We first model the SFC migration problem as an integer linear program and propose an aggressive migration strategy that can effectively reduce the imbalance of physical resource distribution. Then, we employ two state-of-the-art heuristics to allocate resources for subsequent SFC requests. The simulation results show that migrating SFC requests in the initial service queue can bring favorable feedback to subsequent requests as well as network operators. Compared to the conservative migration strategy, our proposed migration strategy can mitigate the imbalance of physical resource distribution more effectively, and thus the acceptance ratio of subsequent SFC requests, physical resources utilization, and the long-term profit of network operators can be further improved.;1932-4537;;10.1109/TNSM.2022.3231186;"Fujian Province Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2020J01574); Industry-university-research Innovation Fund of China(grant numbers:2021FNA05003); CHARITY(grant numbers:101016509); Academy of Finland 6Genesis project(grant numbers:318927); IDEA-MILL(grant numbers:33593); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998123;"Network softwarization;network function virtualization;service function chain migration;and resource allocation";"Resource management;Costs;Substrates;Quality of service;Artificial intelligence;Quality of experience;Virtualization";"cloud computing;integer programming;linear programming;queueing theory;resource allocation;virtualisation";"aggressive migration strategy;conservative migration strategy;core cloud;diverse usage scenarios;initial service queue;migrating SFC requests;migration cost;network operators;network SFC migration problem;next-generation communication networks;physical resource distribution;physical resources utilization;remaining physical resources;service Function Chaining;Service Function Chaining;subsequent requests;subsequent SFC requests";;2;;40;CCBY;23.12.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

In this study, a novel encryption-then-lossy-compression (ETLC) scheme was developed using nonuniform downsampling and a customized deep network. Specifically, the nonuniform downsampling method integrates both uniform and random sampling to achieve an arbitrary compression ratio for an encrypted image. Lossy reconstruction from the decrypted and decompressed image is described as a constrained optimization problem, and an ETLC-oriented customized deep neural network (ETCNN) is elaborately designed to solve this problem. ETCNN contains three parts: channel-wise non-local attention including residual group and non-local sparse attention, a residual content supplementation (RCS), and a downsampling constraint (DC), where RCS and DC are customized modules exploiting specific features of the downsampling-based ETLC system. Extensive experimental simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art ETLC methods remarkably, indicating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme exploiting the nonuniform downsampling and ETCNN-based reconstruction.

Since there is currently no vaccine or treatment method, it poses a major challenge and threat to the pig industry once it breaks out. The results of the investigation show that most existing solutions use laboratory tests to diagnose possible ASF cases. In addition, various machine learning (ML) techniques have been used in the past to diagnose ASF. However, historical review of recent years shows that laboratories have difficulty diagnosing ASF with the required accuracy due to a lack of correlation between causes and effects. Lack of accuracy and incorrect ASF diagnoses by laboratories have proven to be a major problem for pig welfare. Consequently, misdiagnosis of ASF disease can result in severe direct and indirect economic losses to farmers, especially farmers whose income is derived primarily from pig production. While several other researchers have proposed the use of ML for ASF diagnosis, the application of cause-effect relationships between specific viruses and symptoms for ASF diagnosis is still missing. In this systematic literature review, we examine the methods, limitations, and approaches in the existing literature from ML and laboratories for ASF diagnosis. In this review, we evaluate the performance of ML and laboratory techniques for ASF diagnosis. In addition, we compare the performance of the techniques of ML with other statistical approaches such as causal ML and computer vision for ASF diagnosis. In addition, the strengths and weaknesses of ML and laboratory techniques for ASF diagnosis were summarized. A thorough search of relevant databases was performed, and the selected studies were examined using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Nevertheless, the study also indicates an area for improvement, such as the accuracy of ASF diagnosis. The study recommends the use of Causal Reasoning with ML to develop a causal ML model capable of establishing relationships between viruses and symptoms to improve the accuracy of the ASF disease. The application of causal ML is presented as an alternative solution for laboratory diagnosis of ASF, which contributes to the field of the study. In addition, further research could investigate the possible characteristics of ASF, including virus variants originating from the ASF family. The review could provide essential information on ASF datasets based on the interpretation of results obtained from the use of appropriate samples and validated tests in combination with the information from laboratory tests of ASF disease epidemiology, scenario, clinical signs, and lesions produced by different virulence. This review concludes that more studies are needed for improving the accuracy and implementation of the causal ML model for ASF diagnosis in real-time surveillance systems.;;979-8-3503-1480-9;10.1109/icABCD59051.2023.10220551;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220551;"Causal Inference;Causal Machine Learning (CML);African Swine Fever (ASF);Systematic Literature Review";"Economics;Systematics;Computer viruses;Bibliographies;Surveillance;Production;Real-time systems";"agriculture;computer vision;diseases;epidemics;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;reviews";"African swine fever;ASF datasets;ASF diagnosis;ASF disease epidemiology;computer vision;laboratory techniques;laboratory tests;machine learning;ML model;real-time surveillance systems;systematic literature review;virulence;virulent infectious disease";;;;46;IEEE;24.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

It can grow well in harsh conditions and is resistant to common herbicides like glyphosate. It causes stress to crops and spreads quickly, forming large patches. Early detection of Kochia is crucial for its effective control. However, it is challenging to detect Kochia due to its close resemblance with early-stage crops. As Kochia seeds are water and air-borne, these can also spread in the field from neighbouring farms. Therefore, Kochia needs to be managed both at the field as well as regional levels. Currently, object-based detection methods are used for Kochia detection at the field level, but there is still a lack of literature on mapping Kochia at a regional level. Our research proposes a methodology for accurately detecting, localizing and quantifying Kochia plants in fields using high-resolution RGB imagery. We also explore the potential of detecting Kochia patches at a regional level using satellite imagery. Our approach uses semantic segmentation techniques to process geotagged RGB images, allowing us to identify and quantify individual Kochia plants in the field. To ensure accurate detection, we have established a minimum Kochia density threshold based on the density of Kochia in RGB images. This threshold enables us to distinguish the spectral signature of satellite imagery pixels containing a high density of Kochia. We label the satellite imagery based on the geo-locations where Kochia density exceeds the threshold value. Our method has a 99% accuracy rate in detecting Kochia patches using multi-spectral satellite imagery with a density threshold of 40%. The semantic segmentation model trained on RGB imagery for in-field mapping has a mean intersection over union value of up to 0.8606. These results suggest pixel-level Kochia segmentation of satellite imagery can be performed more accurately if a pixel has more than 40% Kochia mix. Our study highlights the potential of using high-resolution RGB imagery and satellite data at the farm and regional levels for effective Kochia management.

However, parameter calibration is cumbersome, which makes the use of VS robotic systems inconvenient. Besides, dynamic fruits usually lead to a degeneration of control while tracking. To overcome the drawbacks, we present a new image-based uncalibrated visual servoing (IBUVS) control approach, consisting of a hybrid visual configuration and an adaptive tracking controller, referred to as hybrid-IBUVS. Specifically, our hybrid-IBUVS employs an eye-in-hand camera and a fixed red–green–blue-depth camera to construct a hybrid VS system, basing on multiobject detection and edge-computing technologies. Meanwhile, we also propose adaptive laws to online estimate the uncalibrated parameters of the cameras and robot dynamics. Furthermore, our hybrid-IBUVS uses an adaptive tracking controller to guarantee the harvesting robot to track a predefined trajectory to approach a fruit target. By Lyapunov stability theory, asymptotic convergence of the proposed control scheme is rigorously proven. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

This work is intended to concurrently use spatial and temporal information from multimodal remotely sensed images in order to fully investigate these diverse characteristics. With the goal to make use of their supportive nature, Spatio temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (STCNN), is proposed as a revolutionary deep learning architecture for agricultural production prediction. To recognize the combined spatial-temporal representation, the STCNN specifically combines a spatial training segment and a temporal dependent segment into the convolutional network. The innovative spatial training segment begins by extracting enough spatial information from the multimodal spatial images. Then, in order to determine the temporal connection from the lengthy time-series images, the temporal dependent segment is concatenated on top of the spatial training segment. Both common machine learning techniques and cutting-edge deep learning techniques are compared to the outcomes of the proposed method.

The performance of most robust model fitting techniques heavily depends on the use of sampling algorithms. In this paper, we propose an efficient guided sampling algorithm for multi-structure data by using the neighborhood consensus and the residual sorting. Specifically, a Neighborhood Consensus based Strategy (NCS) is first proposed to select the first datum (i.e., seed datum) of a minimal subset, and then a Residual Sorting based Strategy (RSS) samples the rest data of the minimal subset based on the seed datum. This strategy effectively combines the benefits of neighborhood consensus and residual sorting, where neighborhood consensus can judge whether a selected data point is an inlier, and residual sorting encourages this strategy to select data points from the same structure of the first selected data point. Moreover, to achieve better fitting performance, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo process is used to combine NCS with the random selection strategy to select the seed datum, and an appropriate size is set to the initial block of randomly sampled hypotheses for RSS. Experimental results on three vision tasks (e.g., two-view motion segmentation and 3D motion segmentation) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance to several state-of-the-art sampling algorithms.;1558-2205;;10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3230736;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172197,61972187,62171130); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province and Anhui Province(grant numbers:2020J01825,2020J02024,2108085MF205); Fuzhou Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2022-R-001); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC3302200); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9992288;"Robust model fitting;guided sampling;neighborhood consensus;residual sorting;multi-structure data";"Sorting;Data models;Prediction algorithms;Periodic structures;Geometric modeling;Computer vision;Three-dimensional displays";"artificial intelligence;computer vision;image sampling;image segmentation;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;sampling methods;sorting;stereo image processing";"artificial intelligence;data point selection;Markov Chain Monte Carlo process;multistructure data;neighborhood consensus based strategy;random selection strategy;randomly sampled hypotheses;residual sorting based strategy;robust model fitting;sampling algorithm";;;;45;IEEE;19.12.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Agribusiness occupies more than 60% of the country’s land, which feeds 1.428 billion people. The cultivation of plants and animals is known as agriculture. Farmers face a lot of hardship while using conventional farming techniques and also face heavy losses every year. Digital farming helps increase productivity by precisely determining the steps that need to be practiced at the appropriate time. It can be done in a laboratory, but it consumes a lot of time. That’s why nowadays researchers are focusing on digital farming techniques because it takes less time and give better results. Till date, many studies have been conducted to improve agricultural planning. In this research, we present an intelligent system called Digital Farming, which intends to assist the farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow, the fertilizer needed to improve the productivity of soil, and the water supply needed according to the soil. Not only the soil type and crop type play an important role in crop yield, but pests and weeds present in the agricultural fields also lead to heavy losses to the farmers, so the proposed model also detects the pests and weeds present in the field and also recommends pesticides. The work uses Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for soil classification, crop recommendation and fertilizer recommendation, for pest detection and pesticides recommendation it uses K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) for weed detection it uses Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Therefore, scarcity of water for irrigation is observed in many potato fields. Here we have proposed a smart irrigation system for optimum usage of water during irrigation in potato fields. Prior to performing smart irrigation, various soil parameters were monitored, like soil type, humidity, and temperature of the atmosphere. To ensure the quality of water that is to be supplied to the potato plants, the water pH was also checked. Data from the sensors were transferred to the edge server using Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology and from the edge server to the cloud using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol.

Such less favorable climatic conditions create greater risks that affect crop production as well as threatens food security. Tracking plant health can help mitigate the heat stress due to global warming. Technology plays a central role in mitigating the pressure the farming industry is facing. Smart sensor systems take advantage of machine learning algorithms and modern computer hardware to create a smart node that is tailored specifically for sensing applications. These sensor systems combine ML and IoT technologies to assist the agriculture industry with innovative ideas and technological advancements to increase yields and improve farm performance. Also, having a good machine learning model with good performance could help farmers and governments to make early decisions to mitigate the impact of environmental changes that reduce the quantity or quality of crops. In our research, we attempt to detect heat stress by using an in-situ ML-enabled subsurface sensor system in an agricultural field so that the device can independently make inferences. The sensor node is buried in the soil and we need a machine-learning model to predict the ambient temperature based on the soil characteristics data and the heat stress would be detected using the ambient temperature. In order to find a machine learning model, a publicly available dataset with the soil variables was evaluated for performance using different machine learning algorithms to predict the air temperature at the subsurface. This trained ML model would be deployed in an FPGA in the field that is equipped with soil sensors.

Plant Disease Classification and Identification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network;"E. Kaliappan; S. Rafi";"Easwari Engineering College (Autonomous); Easwari Engineering College (Autonomous)";2023 World Conference on Communication & Computing (WCONF);4.9.2023;2023;;;1;5;The first step in effectively and accurately preventing plant disease in a complicated environment is to identify the diseased plants. Given the rapidity development is occurring. The recognition of diseased plants is made computerised and data-driven as a result of smart farming, enabling enhanced assistance with decisions, clever analysis, and management. Plant Disease has developed widely, necessitating precise investigation and quick deep learning applications in the classification of plant diseases. When a plant is sick, it may exhibit a variety of signs and symptoms, such as coloured streaks or spots on the leaves. The colour, structure, and proportions of the visual symptoms alter as the disease worsens. Deep CNN can be used to train these patterns and produce a model that can identify them. The framework was designed and developed using the MobileNet V2 architecture. A 94% accuracy rate was reached after training on a chosen dataset. Using the chosen topology for 30 epochs results in the development of a convolutional neural network. For this undertaking, a user interface may also be designed. Farmers can use any smartphone with an adequate camera to take pictures of plant leaves by utilising the application. Multiple disorders can be identified using the smartphone application, making it simpler for users. Along with the diagnosis of plant diseases, pesticide recommendations and precautions for the recognised diseases are also recommended. This research offers a deep learning method for automating the detection of plant diseases. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used in the created system.;;979-8-3503-1120-4;10.1109/WCONF58270.2023.10235145;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10235145;"Convolutional neural network;Machine learning;Plant Disease;Detection";"Deep learning;Training;Smart agriculture;Plant diseases;Visualization;Network topology;Pesticides";"convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pesticides;plant diseases;smart phones";"deep convolutional neural network;disease worsens;diseased plants;plant Disease classification;plant leaves";;;;11;IEEE;4.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Based on the deployment of edge devices, we made some improvements to You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) to form a new, lightweight, high-performance detector named LN-STEP-YOLO. In order to reduce the size of the model, we halved the number of channels in the YOLOv5s model. However, the decrease in the number of channels brings some problems, such as low global information acquisition, retention of image redundancy information, attention deficit, etc. To solve these problems, we did the following work. First, we proposed a new convolution structure with the effect of a large convolution kernel, StepConv. Second, a  $2\times 2$  convolution with step size 2 was used at the input to split each image into individual patches. Third, External Attention (EA) was introduced in the bottleneck structure. Fourth, a modified extremely separated convolutional block (XsepConv) was used for downsampling. Finally, we replaced the batch normalization (BN) of all non-downsampled layers with layer normalization (LN). The results showed that the improved algorithm outperformed generic lightweight networks such as Mixnet, Mobilenetv3, and Ghostnet to distinguish small-sized, overlapping pigeons, achieving 92.8% mean average precision (mAP) at about 17% of YOLOv5s parameters, 0.1% lower than that achieved by use of YOLOv5s. In addition, the improved method had 3.7G floating point operations (FLOPs) and 1.25G parameters, which allowed the detection of the growth stages of pigeons in real environments and provided a reference to guide placement of feeders in automated pigeon farming.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3267483;"Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B0202080002,2021B0202030001,2019B020215001); Department of Education of Guangdong Province Bureau(grant numbers:2020ZDZX1060); Fund for Science and Technology from Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515010834,2018A0303130034); Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:202002030154,201903010063); Fund for Guangzhou Rural Science and Technology Commissioner Project(grant numbers:20212100058); Fund from Guangzhou Science and Technology Bureau(grant numbers:201803020033); Guangdong Provincial University Key Field Special Project(grant numbers:2022ZDZX4019); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103542;"Pigeon;accurate feeding;overlap;greater receptive field;layer normalization";"Convolutional neural networks;Feeds;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Feature extraction";"biology computing;convolutional neural nets;image sampling;object detection;zoology";"attention deficit;automated pigeon farming;batch normalization;BN;bottleneck structure;convolution kernel;convolution structure;downsampling;EA;edge devices;external attention;f network transmission;floating point operations;FLOPs;generic lightweight networks;high-performance detector;image redundancy information;layer normalization;lightweight performance detector;LN;LN-STEP-YOLO;low global information acquisition;modified extremely separated convolutional block;nondownsampled layers;pigeons;StepConv;XsepConv;YOLOv5;You Only Look Once version 5";;1;;42;CCBYNCND;17.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Plant health monitoring and disease detection are essential for sustainable agriculture. To protect plants against pathogen damage, farmers must be able to detect an infection prior to its obviousness. Effective plant disease detection technique can greatly lessen the use of toxic chemicals thereby aiding a better environment. For diseases to be managed effectively, plant pathogens must be accurately detected. The pathogens that cause plant diseases include bacteria, fungi, viruses, oomycetes, nematodes, phytoplasmas, protozoa, and parasitic plants. In this paper pathogen-based plant disease detection is done. An automated plant disease detection and its classification are done along with identifying the pathogen responsible for it using keras transfer learning models. This is done by considering Agri-ImageNet dataset as well as images of leaves, bulb, and flowers of sunflower and cauliflower captured in a natural realistic environment. This dataset overcomes the drawback of PlantVillage dataset in which images are captured in homogeneous backgrounds and controlled settings. These problems can be solved by reusing knowledge representations through deep transfer learning. Main objective of this paper is to explore and analyze all the deep transfer learning models, to identify which model is best suited for plant disease dataset. This work has been carried out by using 38 deep transfer learning models to obtain best classification accuracy. EfficientNetV2B2 and EfficientNetV2B3 models’ give highest accuracy in comparison with all other deep transfer learning models for sunflower, cauliflower and Agri-ImageNet datasets.

Next, the imagined beat pulses were estimated from the EEG during the task based on spatiotemporal convolutional neural network models. We employed a CNN and an EEGNet to evaluate the model’s performance with binary cross entropy and focal loss as AUC and F1-measure.

The main issue in the agricultural sector is leaf diseases, which have an impact on crop yield and financial gain. Early detection of leaf diseases in plants is essential to prevent losses to the agricultural sector. There are several tomato leaf diseases that affect the crop’s leaves, including the Mosaic virus, Early Blight, Healthy, Septoria leaf, and Bacterial spot. Using deep learning algorithms and image processing methods, we can identify the diseases in tomato leaves using developing deep learning approaches. The implementation procedures in our proposed work involves data collection, pre-processing, training, feature extraction, testing, and classification utilising the Visual Geometry Group (VGG 16) to identify damaged or healthy leaves. VGG 16 is incorporated to categorise the leaves as healthy or diseased based on the data and Regression’s boundary box method is adopted. Therefore, using Faster RCNN, a model is created to identify and categorise diseases from every image of a tomato leaf that is used as an input, providing a forecast with a considerably greater degree of accuracy.

With the progress of computer technology, China, as the first apple planting country in the world, also needs to change to a digital and intelligent working mode. As apples are easy to be attacked by various diseases and pests during planting, and the early pathological changes mainly occur in leaves, especially mottle leaf disease, gray spot disease, rust and cedar rust. How to find these diseases in time and quickly make accurate classification is the key to subsequent treatment. In this paper, Based on the ResNet50 network architecture, the attention mechanism is added to design the new work model needed to improve the accuracy of disease identification. Aiming at the problem of small sample size of apple tree disease image dataset, we uses the idea of transfer learning to upgrade the network model training process.

Crops have different absorption and reflection characteristics in different bands, which gives hyperspectral images a natural advantage in crop classification. The academic community has also made progress in this area through a series of studies. This is of great significance for accurately obtaining the spatial distribution information of crops and realizing precision and intelligent management in agricultural production. However, hyperspectral data have low spatial resolution and suffers from mixed pixel interference and lack of spatial information description for crops. Meanwhile, influenced by the phenological characteristics of crops, different crops respond differently to the same spectrum during the same phenological period, and similarly, the spectral response of the same crop varies at different phenological stages. This phenomenon leads to typical intra-class and inter-class feature differences, which increase the complexity of hyperspectral crop classification. To address the issues of missing spatial information and inconsistent spectral responses, We propose a prior-guided and data-driven deep learning method for crop classification in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, named Cross-scale Enhancement Network (CSENet). This method couples index features and incorporates them as prior knowledge to the network. Firstly, we utilize the phenological differences of different crops to select the spectral bands with significant responses and perform feature dimension reduction; Secondly, we utilize the high reflectance characteristics of vegetation in the near-infrared band and introduce multiple classic vegetation indices to construct a spectral feature library as prior knowledge to enrich the network features. Finally, a cross-scale enhancement attention mechanism is designed to obtain multi-scale crop features and compensate for the lack of spatial description information of crops. In addition, a cross-channel enhancement module is further constructed to deeply explore the spectral information and solve the problem of confusion caused by similar spectral characteristics, making the network more robust and resistant to interference in crop classification task of hyperspectral imagery. Unlike the traditional pixel-by-pixel approach for hyperspectral classification, CSENet employs a fully convolutional network architecture with a markedly reduced parameter count and faster inference speed. We selected typical crops such as wheat, rice, rape, and potatoes to evalute algorithm in Inner Mongolia. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has a good feature classification ability for typical crops and also has the conditions for practical application in terms of time efficiency.";;979-8-3503-0351-3;10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics59224.2023.10233574;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10233574;"Hyperspectral image;Crop classification;Prior knowledge;Data-driven;Attention mechanism";"Knowledge engineering;Time series analysis;Stability criteria;Crops;Vegetation mapping;Interference;Data models";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);phenology;remote sensing;vegetation;vegetation mapping";"agricultural vegetation indices;couples index features;crop classification task;crop type classification Network;cross-scale enhancement network;feature classification ability;hyperspectral classification;hyperspectral crop classification;hyperspectral data;hyperspectral imagery;hyperspectral remote sensing imagery;hyperspectral remote sensing images;inter-class feature differences;multiscale crop features;phenological differences;prior-guided data-driven deep learning method;reflection characteristics;rich spectral features;spatial description information;spatial distribution information;spatial information description;spectral bands;spectral characteristics;spectral feature library";;;;26;IEEE;1.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Leaf Based Tomato Plant Disease Detection Using Generated Images from WGP-ESR GAN;"P. Harinadha; C.

Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for improving agricultural yields. In this paper, we are using deep learning techniques for detecting the diseases of tomato plants based on leaf images. Image gathering of diseased plant leaves from various plants leads to unbalanced disease classes. Such unbalanced disease classes are not suitable for the effective training of disease classifiers. So we are proposing a deep-learning model, WGP-ESR GAN(Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty and Enhanced Super Resolution GAN) to create a well-balanced dataset. The model consists of two stages. In the first stage, WGAN-GP generates 3x64x64 sized tomato plant leaf images, which are then inputted to ESRGAN in the second stage to produce realistic 3x256x256 sized images. Initially, the model was trained with only healthy tomato leaf images to get a pre-trained model, and then we continued the training process on a pre-trained model with unhealthy leaves. This process generates a well-balanced dataset of each class size is 5357. Disease classifiers (VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) are employed, and the Plant Village dataset is used for training and performance testing. The proposed model's generated images exhibit higher realism than state-of-the-art models, and the average classification accuracy of the balanced dataset generated by WGP-ESR (99.69 percent) is significantly improved than state-of-the-art models.;;979-8-3503-0159-5;10.1109/ICDSNS58469.2023.10245332;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10245332;"Unbalanced classes;Tomato plant diseases;WGAN-GP;Enhanced Super Resolution";"Training;Deep learning;Plant diseases;Superresolution;Network security;Data science;Generative adversarial networks";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);plant diseases";"agricultural products;agricultural yields;class size;deep learning techniques;deep-learning model;disease classifiers;diseased plant;effective training;enhanced super resolution GAN;healthy tomato leaf images;image gathering;performance testing;plant village dataset;tomato plant disease detection;tomato plant leaf images;training process;unbalanced disease classes;Wasserstein generative adversarial network;well-balanced dataset;WGP-ESR GAN";;;;20;IEEE;22.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Most of the existing methods use a backbone to extract initial features with independent branches for each task, and the exchange of information between the branches usually occurs through the concatenation or sum of the feature maps of the branches. However, this type of information exchange does not directly consider the local characteristics of the image nor the level of importance or correlation between the tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method, MTLSegFormer, which combines multi-task learning and attention mechanisms. After the backbone feature extraction, two feature maps are learned for each task. The first map is proposed to learn features related to its task, while the second map is obtained by applying learned visual attention to locally re-weigh the feature maps of the other tasks. In this way, weights are assigned to local regions of the image of other tasks that have greater importance for the specific task. Finally, the two maps are combined and used to solve a task. We tested the performance in two challenging problems with correlated tasks and observed a significant improvement in accuracy, mainly in tasks with high dependence on the others.;2160-7516;979-8-3503-0249-3;10.1109/CVPRW59228.2023.00669;"Nvidia; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10208835;;"Visualization;Shape;Semantic segmentation;Feature extraction;Transformers;Multitasking;Decoding";"agriculture;feature extraction;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence)";"backbone feature extraction;correlated tasks;feature maps;initial features;multitask learning;semantic segmentation method";;;;43;IEEE;14.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Therefore, reducing expenses and raising crop productivity are essential. In a country like India, where there are hundreds of fields, weeds are always growing there. Weeds and crops fight for space, water, food, nutrients, and other resources, which reduces agricultural output. Currently, one of agriculture’s most difficult duties is weed control. Herbicide hand spraying is one of the most popular weed management techniques. However, this strategy has a number of shortcomings. Because manual labor is costly, an automated weed management system may be economically viable. There is currently no technology available that can be utilized in the field in real time to autonomously control in-row weeds, despite repeated attempts. Weed control has become more important as food grain production has increased per person. The suggested system makes an effort to provide a robotic, computer vision-based Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for real-time weed management in row crops in order to address the aforementioned issues.

Earlier, crop cultivation was based on farmers' prowess. There are many types of soil, each of which has its own unique properties and specialty, ensuring the proper cultivation of a particular crop. However, the changes in climate and temperature have adversely affected the yield of crops, so farmers cannot choose the correct crop to be grown based on environmental factors. Accurate crop prediction will lead to increased crop production, resulting in high revenue. Crop prediction using ensemble learning is the process of integrating various learning algorithms to make predictions.

With the development of technology, IoT is being implemented not only in agriculture industries, healthcare sectors, and artificial intelligence, but also in education sectors. As the world is being completely digitized, the education system is also being digitized. Today, virtually all colleges and universities utilize a Learning Management System (LMS). These systems not only aid administrators in keeping track of the records of teachers, students, and attendance, but also assist students in preparing the subject-related materials provided by the teacher. Using sensors and actuators, we can produce even more intelligent classrooms. They collect student data by evaluating their facial expressions during class. The collected data can then be used to generate an alert to the relevant instructor regarding students' behaviors that are causing confusion during the lecture. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model that can observe student behavior in class using smart cameras and then upload that data to a learning management system (LMS) so that the instructor can make decisions about his teaching methodology.

In a mobile ad hoc network, each node functions as a router and finds the best path forwarding a packet via origin to destination. This network is important in places where building a framework is impossible, like in a military setting. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a temporary network created by unrestricted nodes that can move around and communicate without a centralized network. In a black hole attack, several or even more attacker node use a tunnel-like private channel to find a wormhole attack. Wormhole tunnel will then start collecting the data packets and transferring them to another location. The proposed work encouraged secure and effective routing in MANET.

These fields really tend to help mankind a lot. In this work, we would make use of Machine Learning aspects to perform prediction of diseases in plant. Specifically, spot the Early Blight Disease in the Potato Leaves. The potato plant, Solanum tuberosum, is a significant crop that is grown all over the world and generates large quantities of tubers that are a good source of nutrients. The potato has many medicinal benefits in addition to being a common staple diet. When the fluid out from tubers is consumed in moderation, it can treat gastric ulcers and relieve inflammation and acidity. Two harmful potato diseases, late blight and early blight, are pervasive. Everywhere potatoes are cultivated, both are present. The labels “Early” and “Late” allude to the relative timing of their field emergence, however both disorders might manifest simultaneously. In this work, we would focus on Early Blight. The fungus Alternaria solani, that can infect potatoes, tomatoes, several species of the potato genus, and some mustards, is the cause of early blight of potatoes. Young, actively growing plants are rarely impacted by this disease, commonly known as target spot. It first appears on elder leaves. Warm temperatures and heavy humidity foster Early Blight. This disease affects the tuber symptomized by dark, rounded to irregular dots being developed on the tuber. As the disease develops, the flesh of the potatoes commonly becomes water-soaked yellow to greenish yellow. For this work, we have collected a set of nearly 1000 samples of Early Blight affected Potato Leaves. Using that, we have modelled a Machine Learning Classification Paradigm that could potentially predict the occurrence of Early Blight Disease making using of classical classifier algorithms.

A Deep Features Extraction Model Based on the Transfer Learning Model and Vision Transformer “TLMViT” for Plant Disease Classification;"A. Tabbakh; S. S.

The agriculture industry is negatively impacted by plant diseases causing crop and economic loss. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for managing and controlling plant diseases, as traditional methods can be costly and time-consuming. Deep learning-based tools effectively detect plant diseases depending on the qualitative of extracted features. In this regard, a hybrid model for plant disease classification based on a Transfer Learning-based model followed by a vision transformer (TLMViT) is proposed. TLMViT has four stages: 1) data acquisition, where the PlantVillage and wheat datasets are used to train and evaluate the proposed model, 2) image augmentation to increase the number of training samples and overcome the overfitting issue, 3) leaf feature extraction by two consecutive phases: initial features extraction by using pre-trained based model and deep features extraction by using ViT model, and 4) classification by using MLP classifier. TLMViT is experimented with using five pre-trained-based models followed by ViT individually. TLMViT performs accurately in plant disease classification, obtaining 98.81% and 99.86% validation accuracy for VGG19 followed by the ViT model on PlantVillage and wheat datasets respectively. Moreover, TLMViT is compared with pre-trained-based architecture. The comparison result illustrates that TLMViT achieved an enhancement of 1.11% and 1.099% in validation accuracy, 2.576% and 2.92% in validation loss compared with the transfer learning-based model for PlantVillage and wheat datasets respectively.

This event occurs when the minimum ambient temperature falls below a certain value. This phenomenon causes a lot of damage to the country, especially Fars province. Solving this problem requires that, in addition to predicting the minimum temperature, we can provide enough time to implement the necessary measures. Empirical methods have been provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which can predict the minimum temperature, but not in time. In addition to this, we can use machine learning methods to model the minimum temperature. In this study, we have used three methods Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as deep learning methods, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). A customized loss function designed for methods based on deep learning, which can be effective in reducing prediction errors. With methods based on deep learning models, not only do we observe a reduction in RMSE error compared to empirical methods but also have more time to predict minimum temperature. Thus, we can model the minimum temperature for the next 24 hours by having the current 24 hours. With the gradient boosting model (XGBoost) we can keep the prediction time as deep learning and RMSE error reduced. Finally, we experimentally concluded that machine learning methods work better than empirical methods and XGBoost model can have better performance in this problem among other implemented.;;979-8-3503-3819-5;10.1109/CSICC58665.2023.10105391;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105391;"Frost Prediction;Minimum Temperature Modeling;GRU;TCN;XGBoost;Deep Learning;Gradient Boosting";"Deep learning;Temperature measurement;Computational modeling;Wind speed;Predictive models;Boosting;Agriculture";"agricultural products;agriculture;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets";"customized loss function;deep learning methods;empirical methods;Fars province;frost prediction;gated recurrent unit;gradient boosting model;GRU;hazards;machine learning methods;minimum ambient temperature;prediction error reduction;prediction time;RMSE error;TCN;temporal convolutional network;time 24.0 hour;XGBoost model";;;;19;IEEE;26.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

As a result, the standard technique depends on physical identification and determining insects to estimate pest recurrence. Farmers face difficulties in recognizing agricultural insects because pest diseases cause significant harvest loss and quality decline. To predict pest recurrence, the traditional technique depends on physical investigation, identification, and calculating insects. The drawback of existing pest recognition model is that it requires expert biologists to accurately identify pests based on visible characteristics. According to the Indian Food and Agriculture Organization, certain natural plants have the potential to reduce total efficiency by 25 to 35%. The majority of approaches for finding pesticide components have also been observational. Pesticides are evaluated with little to no prior knowledge of the mechanism of action in order to select those that kill the target bug, fungus, or weed while causing no harm to the environment. Initially, the proposed methodology involved in providing a reliable reference information for the detection model by augmenting image information and performing different operations on it. To check the accuracy of the recognition and analysis model for crop pests, the related pest image identification and evaluation framework is designed by Inception-ResNet-v2 and VGG16 network of learning. Then, using the concept of an incorporated technique, the two improved CNN sequence pest picture identification and framework are merged successfully. The network is then improved by using the augmented pest dataset. The IDADP (Image Database for Agricultural Diseases and Pests Research) data serves as the foundation for the result of simulation.

Climate change has made rainfall amounts unpredictable, which can lead to either overflow or drying of reservoirs. Monitoring changing rainfall patterns is essential to understand the impact on climate change, agriculture, and daily life. Accurate rainfall forecasting is crucial for countries like India, which heavily rely on cultivation. However, due to the vibrant type of the environment, statistical practices often decline to give accurate rainfall predictions. Global warming, a pressing concern that affects humankind, is accelerating climate change, causing oceans and the atmosphere to warm, and leading to floods and droughts. Uneven rainfall/precipitation is one of the foremost effects of such phenomenon. Precipitation estimating has become tedious and is being counted by main world agencies. Precipitation is a critical climatical feature that influence being activities like farming manufacture, construction, energy production, and tourism. Hence, accurate rainfall forecasting is essential to mitigate these effects.

In this paper, we proposed a navigation line extraction method for agriculture based on Pix2Pix net with image pre-processing. We first separated the crops from the background to remove useless information. Then the binary image would go through the Pix2Pix net that would draw a red line following the crop row near the middle of the image. After that, we extracted the red line and used the least square to calculate the angle to guide the robot along the crops. The experiments indicated that image pre-processing could decline useless data in the picture, leading to a better neural network performance in navigation line extraction.

Current methods of measuring soil nutrients involve collecting soil from the field and transporting it to a laboratory for testing, which is often subjective and very expensive. This paper suggests an efficient IoT-based soil nutrient monitoring and machine learning-based crop recommendation system that helps farmers by offering crop-related details and recommendations for crops based on different soil and weather attributes. The proposed system deploys various types of sensors to determine soil nutrients, these sensors continuously collect the required data from the farm field and transmit it via a wireless sensor network (WSN) to a cloud database. By monitoring (N, P, K, temperature, pH, humidity, rainfall) values and analyzing the permanent and temporary behavior of the soil, the machine learning approach will recommend what types of crops have the best production potential for this land. Agriculture's use of machine-learning technology makes it easier to select the best-yielding crops by reducing the cost of unnecessary fertilizer use, which reduces manual labor in crop and crop management and increases productivity. The most appropriate crops for that cropland are suggested using machine learning algorithms in IoT-based soil nutrient monitoring, which stores data from various soil nutrients in a database. As a result, agricultural production will contribute more to national growth.;;979-8-3503-4536-0;10.1109/ECCE57851.2023.10100744;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100744;"Internet of Things(IoT);Machine Learning(ML);Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);Potential of Hydrogen(pH);Crop Recommendation";"Temperature measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Soil measurements;Crops;Soil;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems";"agriculture;crops;fertilisers;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);nitrogen;phosphorus;potassium;soil;wireless sensor networks";"agricultural yield;efficient IoT-based soil nutrient monitoring;farmers;K/el;machine learning approach;machine learning-based crop recommendation system;N/el;nitrogen;P/el;pH value;phosphorus;potassium;productivity;rainfall;smart soil fertilizer monitoring;soil chemical constituents;soil fertility;wireless sensor network";;;;16;IEEE;19.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

When plants are afflicted with diseases, their yield drastically decreases. Plant disease detection is delayed, resulting in lower yield and plant mortality. Manual disease detection in plants by experts for multiple acres of land necessitates a large number of experts, which raises the cost of production. A plant's disease is typically manifested in its leaf, stem, flower, and fruit. Because disease symptoms appear first on the leaf, it is easier to detect plant disease than on the stem, flower, or fruit. The efficiency of a classifier depends on the feature extraction algorithm. Therefore, it is very necessary to design an automatic leaf-detecting tool that can uncover the type of disease. The advancements in Deep Learning Algorithms [2] improve the accuracy of plant disease classification.;;979-8-3503-9844-1;10.1109/ACCTHPA57160.2023.10083382;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083382;"Plant diseases;Leaf Disease Classification;Machine Learning;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Networks";"Plant diseases;Machine learning algorithms;Shape;Neural networks;Sociology;Production;Manuals";"agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;image classification;plant diseases";"automated leaf disease prediction systems;automatic leaf-detecting tool;disease symptoms;diseases;flower;land necessitates;lower yield;manual disease detection;multiple acres;plant disease classification;plant disease detection;plant mortality;stem";;;;10;IEEE;3.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

In this study, multi-spectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images at three flight altitudes were used to explore the impact of scale effects on the accuracy of CLC estimation. Using multi-spectral images of UAV at different flight heights, 17 spectral indices were calculated. Boruta algorithm was used to select the features of the 17 spectral indices. The screened spectral indices were taken as input variables, and BP neural network regression algorithm was used to construct the CLC estimation model. Coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and interquartile distance (RPIQ) were used as evaluation indexes. The results showed that: (1) the correlation between the spectral index obtained at different flight altitudes and CLC was significantly different. The correlation between the spectral index obtained at 120m flight altitude and CLC was the highest, followed by 80m flight altitude and 100m flight altitude. (2) Different flight altitudes have a great impact on the estimation accuracy of CLC. The estimation accuracy of 100m is the worst, followed by 80m flight altitude, and 120m flight altitude has the best estimation accuracy. R2, RMSE and NRMSE in the modeling set are 0.69, 2.67($\mu$g/cm2) and 5.47%, respectively. In the verification set, the values were 0.54, 3.52($\mu$g/cm2), 7.21%, and RPIQ was 2.21. The above results show that the regression model coupled with Boruta and BP neural network can be used as the best model to estimate CLC at 120m flight altitude.

However, accurately identifying crops in their early stages can be challenging. Considering that agricultural practices (e.g. crop rotation) are regular and they can be important expert knowledge, we propose a classification model using a prior probability-adjusted machine learning algorithms to aid early crop identification. We used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to obtain transfer probabilities for each crop type based on crop cultivation history maps, which were then used as prior probabilities in a Bayesian calculation with classifier probabilities. The results used as prior probabilities for the next model with the incorporation of new observations. We tested the model in the maize belt and cotton belt of the USA, as well as in the Northeast China, and found that classifiers incorporating prior probabilities performed well in all regions (OA > S5% 1-2 months before harvest) for both supervised and unsupervised classification. Furthermore, we explored the classification performance of the proposed method in regions without historical products (but with a small number of samples) by mapping history through transfer classification to calculate prior probabilities and thus classify the target years. We tested in Zhanjiang, China and obtained reasonable accuracy (OA =92%) and crop maps.

Their interpretation is essential for agriculture, ecological environment, and land permeability assessment. This typically requires experts with dual knowledge of geology and remote sensing. With the increasing volume of remote-sensing data, the traditional “visual interpretation” and “field survey” technique is no longer sufficient to meet the demands. Because of the challenges such as the fine structure of soil, complex and variable natural scenes, and strong spatial variability, there remains a considerable gap between the accuracy of deep-learning-based methods and expert interpretation. To improve the accuracy of intelligent soil elements interpretation, this study proposes a soil interpretation framework coupling implicit knowledge with a multispectral image (SIFCIM). This framework quantifies implicit knowledge (IK), such as interpretation symbol and terrain feature, into matrix data [interpretation symbol distance (ISD) field and digital elevation model (DEM)]. To align with the SIFCIM, an IK-guided adaptive feature fusion network (IAFFNet) is constructed, which enhances the utilization efficiency of auxiliary features through an adaptive implicit feature fusion (AIF) module and a global feature dependence (GFD) module. Experimental results demonstrate that IAFFNet outperforms interpretation methods with a single remote-sensing image, achieving approximately 4.34% and 6.62% improvements in overall pixel accuracy (oPA) and mean intersection over union (mIoU), respectively. These results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the IK-guided approach in soil elements interpretation.

It supplies the planet with essential fresh water, especially in areas where groundwater resources are scarce. Hence, a dependable prediction model for rainfall is essential, as it can help predict flooding and monitor pollutant levels. Historically, weather predictions were made using meteorological satellites. But now, with advancements in technology and data analysis, machine learning has been utilized in weather forecasting. However, accurately predicting rainfall remains a complex task and existing methods depend on complex models that may incur high costs due to their extensive computational requirements. This research assesses the effectiveness of both conventional machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques as potential options, by conducting a comprehensive comparison using a uniform case study that analyzed ten years of rainfall data collected from various regions in Australia. Through the comparisons and evaluations, we aim at finding the most feasible method for the detection of weather patterns. The models' performance is measured using metrics such as loss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and Mean Squared Logarithmic Error. The results show that the proposed CNN model is the most accurate among all the models.;;979-8-3503-4536-0;10.1109/ECCE57851.2023.10101560;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10101560;"Deep Learning;Machine Learning;GRU;LSTM;CNN;KNN imputation;Multi-Layer Perceptron;Logistic Regression;Random Forest;Decision Tree;Light GBM;Support Vector;AdaBoost;GNB;KNN;CatBoost Classifier";"Deep learning;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Weather forecasting;Predictive models;Loss measurement;Water pollution";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;data analysis;deep learning (artificial intelligence);floods;geophysics computing;groundwater;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;rain;regression analysis;weather forecasting";"accurately predicting rainfall;Australia;CNN model;complex models;complex task;conventional machine learning algorithms;data analysis;deep learning techniques;dependable prediction model;ecological balance;environmental balance;essential fresh water;extensive computational requirements;flooding;groundwater resources;illustrative case study;meteorological satellites;monitor pollutant levels;rainfall data;uniform case study;weather forecasting;weather patterns;weather predictions";;;;28;IEEE;19.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

As India has a large population, it becomes more important to fulfill the increasing demand and for enhancing the yield of crops we need to save the crops which are affected by the diseases. We can find the disease of the plants by classifying the type of disease the crop has and then we can apply prevention methods. It is done by some experts by using some chemicals to find the disease and it is also time consuming and costly. If we can make an automatic system which can detect the disease by analyzing plant leaves then we can make this process cheaper as well as faster with respect to time taken for finding the disease in crops. For that we can use deep learning models which are used to classify the leaves based on disease they have. In this paper, we are finding the disease on the cassava plant. Because people also eat the leaves of this plant. The aim of this paper is to increase the accuracy and efficiency in comparison to the previously proposed models. Deep learning models are more effective than the machine learning models which we got to know while reading about the work which was done previously on plant disease detection. So that is why we used a deep learning model. In this, we used EfficientNet-B0 with k-fold cross validation. EfficientNet is known as best classification models because they are faster and scale on width, depth, and resolution.

Pakistan being an agricultural country, can widely benefit by cultivating and improving grapes per hectare yield. The biggest challenge in harvesting grapes to date is to detect their cluster successfully; many approaches tend to answer this problem by harvest and sort technique where the foreign objects are separated later from grapes after harvesting them using an automatic harvester. Currently available systems are trained on data that is from developed or grape-producing countries, thus showing data biases when used at any new location thus it gives rise to a need of creating a dataset from scratch to verify the results of research. Grape is available in different sizes, colors, seed sizes, and shapes which makes its detection, through simple Computer vision, even more challenging.

The goal is to aid farmers in adopting focused, efficient treatments by facilitating a more thorough and accurate diagnosis of various disease severity levels. The research uses a federated learning approach among five clients and contains five discrete severity levels of Red Globe grape leaf diseases. Because it trains a global model based on locally calculated updates and keeps data on the client device, the federated learning paradigm used here is unique in how it operates and handles data privacy issues. CNN is a powerful deep-learning method especially effective when examining visual information. The study findings' accuracy, precision, and recall qualities are encouraging for all customers. The customers' scores for local data precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy ranged from 85.60 to 96.62%, 88.82 to 96.54%, 87.50 to 96.58%, and 0.96 to 0.99, respectively. When the model's predictions were further evaluated using global client values, accuracy scores ranged from 90.71 to 95.21%, demonstrating high predictability. A comparison study of averages was conducted to demonstrate the model's effectiveness among customers. The weighted averages ranged from 91.47 to 95.33%, while the macro-averages ranged from 90.90 to 95.25 %. The micro-averages were between 91.45 and 95.32%, consistently demonstrating the model's resilience at all severity levels.

In some countries, there can be as many as 500,000 plantation workers in the palm oil sector as the plantations are usually large. However, such dependence on humans for low skills manual work has led to many problems. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UA Vs) have been seen as a possible alternative to support some of the processes that require low skills in the palm oil industry. However, the flying time of the UAVs is finite and hence it is important to maximize the number of palm trees that each UAV can service. This paper proposes the segmentation of large palm oil estates into smaller areas to be modeled as a bin packing problem with the Jaya Algorithm. The resultant segmented areas would have an optimal number of palm trees that can be comfortably serviced by the UAV.

The agricultural industry is severely endangered by plant diseases and dangerous insects. A vast number of images of plant leaves are employed in the artificial intelligence-based deep learning technique, which is essential in disease identification. To maximize agricultural yield, it is critical to quickly and efficiently identify plant diseases. However, utilizing deep learning techniques is difficult to diagnose diseases with small datasets. In this paper, a transfer learning-based ResNet110 was proposed for quickly diagnosing tomato leaf disease using limited plant data images. The plant village datasets collected from the field consisting of healthy and infected leaves of tomatoes, and the architecture of the convolutional neural network VGG16, VGG17, and ResNet110 are employed to train classifiers. Each classifier's performance was assessed by evaluating its ability to correctly classified the tomato crop. The existing methods such as Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN), a novel fusion of superpixel and color balancing-based approach, Attention Embedded Residual CNN, lightweight CNN model, and Deep-CNN are used to justify the effectiveness of Transfer learning-based ResNet110. The proposed method achieves better accuracy of 99.7% when compared to the existing methods.;;979-8-3503-0159-5;10.1109/ICDSNS58469.2023.10244907;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10244907;"Convolution Neural Network;Deep learning;Hyper-parameter;Tomato Leaf Disease Detection;Transfer Learning";"Deep learning;Training;Industries;Plant diseases;Image color analysis;Insects;Network security";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;plant diseases;production engineering computing";"artificial intelligence-based deep learning technique;deep learning techniques;disease identification;plant data images;plant diseases;plant leaves;plant village datasets;tomato crop;tomato leaf disease;tomato plant leaf disease detection;Transfer learning-based ResNet110;transfer learning-based ResNet110";;;;20;IEEE;22.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The system is based on a scalable distributed deep learning (DL) model trained on dense time series of Sentinel-2 images and a large training set for the first year of observation and fine tuned on new labeled data for the consecutive years. The trained models are used to generate multiyear crop type maps, which are assimilated together with the Sentinel-2 dense time series and the meteorological data into a physically based agrohydrological model to derive the irrigation water demand for different crops.

At the same time, object detection technology shows a trend of multidisciplinary integration, which frees related researchers and some laborers from repetitive labor, thus improving the efficiency and accuracy of their work. Fishery resources play a pivotal role as an important agricultural resource, and the realization of different kinds of fish detection is of great help to the rational use and protection of fishery resources. However, there are some problems in the application of object detection technology to this field, such as the lack of datasets, and the quantity and quality of samples in the data set cannot satisfy the increasingly large neural network models. In this paper, we created a dataset dedicated to fish target detection through various channels such as photography and the web. The dataset contains 16 categories and 1038 images, including common fish (e.g., carp, hairtail, etc.) and also some precious fish such as grouper. We improved the quality of the images to enable the network to learn more accurate information about the characteristics of different fish. Meanwhile, we propose BIAS-YOLO, which improves the original SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling) module based on the original YOLOv5 network, and introduced the idea of spatial bias, which can encode the global information and thus improve the network to make full use of the whole image information.

In the study of face cognition, rapid serial face cognition (RSVP), the presentation of target and non-target images, is often used to understand the cognition mechanism. When a person perceives the target image, the event-related potential (ERP) is evoked. To identify the target image or the event of interest of a person, the classification model machine learning is introduced. However, the machine learning model that works the best when applied to ERP is still in question. This study aimed to investigate the simplest machine learning model that performs best when comparing six classification models applied to ERP peak evoked during the partial face cognition task. The six models used in this investigation were linear discrimination analysis (LDA), xDAWN filter + linear support vector machine (SVM), xDAWN filter + LightGBM, xDAWN covariance matrix + tangent space + linear SVM, xDAWN covariance matrix + tangent space + LightGBM, and xDAWN covariance matrix + minimum distance to mean (MDM). As a result, we found that the xDAWN covariance matrix improved the classification performance compared to combining the xDAWN filter with the same classification models. In addition, the combination of the xDAWN covariance matrix and MDM provided the best performance in participant-dependent cross-validation. In contrast, the xDAWN covariance matrix, tangent space, and LightGBM provided the most promising performance in the participant-independent cross-validation.;;979-8-3503-2641-3;10.1109/ITC-CSCC58803.2023.10212494;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212494;"electroencephalogram (EEG);event-related potential (ERP);machine learning;xDAWN;face cognition";"Support vector machines;Maximum likelihood detection;Face recognition;Machine learning;Nonlinear filters;Brain modeling;Spatial filters";"bioelectric potentials;brain-computer interfaces;cognition;electroencephalography;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pattern classification;signal classification;spatial filters;support vector machines";"classification model machine learning;classification models;cognition mechanism;crucial cognition processes;nontarget images;P300-Based Partial Face Recognition;partial face cognition task;rapid serial face cognition;simplest machine learning model;target image;xDAWN covariance matrix;xDAWN filter + LightGBM;xDAWN spatial filter";;1;;23;IEEE;15.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Theoretical and empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of DTW over the standard euclidean distance metric employed in prior methods for the image domain.

Most existing studies on the analysis of the amount of Bacillus were conducted in laboratories. Performing such a task on open field farming is difficult because only a small data set is available during a long observation period for the soil analysis of Bacillus. For example, turmeric growth takes nine months with one soil sample per month, and we found that increasing the frequency of soil analysis for turmeric growth is not practically useful. Therefore, we can only collect a very small data set for AI training. This article proposes the AgriTalk approach that predicts the amount of Bacillus based on novel IoT and machine learning technologies. AgriTalk uses a small data set (five data items) per farm for training and performs prediction for the subsequent four months. Good results are obtained. Specifically, the inference mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) range from 6.73% to 19.76%. In the experiments of five farm fields, we have correctly captured the trends for the number of changes of Bacillus. Such prediction provides useful information for fertilization management.

Weather factors, including rainfall and temperature, largely influence the disease severity and spread of infection in crops. Significant growth has been achieved using RNN models for time series forecasting in the past few decades, but these models are not applied to fruit rot disease prediction. This study introduces Vanilla GRU, Stacked GRU, Bidirectional GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM models for the inaugural prediction of fruit rot disease scores using past weather data. The current investigation also involves the mitigation and comparison of forecast inaccuracies by utilising weight optimisation algorithms like Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, and Genetic algorithms. Meteorological and disease score data are gathered from the Agricultural Research Station in Brahmavar, Karnataka, and CPCRI Kasargod, Kerala. These datasets are combined using a rule-based algorithm to train and evaluate the proposed model. Empirical outcomes reveal that the vanilla GRU model, when fine-tuned with the Adam algorithm, exhibits a diminished Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 0.0009, an exceptionally minimal Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value of 0.02, and an elevated R-squared (R2) score of 0.99. Similarly, the Bidirectional LSTM model, optimised through RMSprop, yields an impressively low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value of 0.033. Generally, the optimised Deep Learning (DL) models consistently demonstrate enhanced predictive precision compared to alternative models.

Discrimination of different types of crops is a common requirement for mechanized crop management which includes tasks such as identifying pests, predicting crop yield etc. High resolution remote sensing data has been extensively used for various agricultural applications. Supervised classification has been the method of choice for crop discrimination in high resolution multispectral imagery. Considering the increasing complexity of agricultural lands wherein the co-occurrence of a host of crops and other urban landscape features is a common scenario evolved, classification of high resolution multispectral imagery using traditional supervised approaches is fraught with ambiguities and may lead to site-specific. We have explored the potential of high resolution multispectral satellite imagery (CARTOSAT-2D) for classifying horticultural crops under a complex landscape composition (rice, sugarcane, coconut, arecanut, forest, fallow land, urban, and water body) in Shivmogga region of Karnataka. Based on the selective ground truth data augmentation from implementing two traditional machine learning algorithms, we have adopted two popular deep learning (DL) network architectures: CNN based U-net and Seg net for the regional level classification of crops under complex agricultural settings. Validation of the results with independent ground truth data indicates fairly good accuracy of about 89 percent from the DL methods implemented. However, the accuracy of the results from the Random Forest algorithm is also competitive (about 80 percent) indicating the continued relevance of traditional ML models to crop classification at regional level.;;979-8-3503-4542-1;10.1109/MIGARS57353.2023.10064521;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064521;"multispectral satellite imagery;deep learning;CNN.";"Deep learning;Image resolution;Satellites;Sociology;Crops;Network architecture;Task analysis";"convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing;horticulture;image classification;random forests;remote sensing";"agricultural lands;arecanut;CARTOSAT-2D;CNN-based U-net;coconut;crop management;deep learning;fallow land;forest;high resolution multispectral satellite imagery;horticultural crops;image classification;India;Karnataka;random forest;remote sensing;rice;Seg net;Shivmogga region;sugarcane;supervised classification";;1;;8;IEEE;16.3.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Similarly, tomatoes are the most widely cultivated vegetables in the agricultural field. In addition, the tropical weather increases the throughput yield of tomato crops. However, various climatic conditions and other factors affect the growth of the tomato plant. Rather than such climate conditions and natural disasters, plant diseases are the primary reason for the production crisis resulting in less tomato yield and financial disaster. Traditional methods for detecting diseases in tomato leaves failed to produce the expected outcomes, and disease detection seemed static. However, making the vegetable plants healthy with time is becoming very significant. Identifying diseases in vegetable plants is essential before they cause too severe harm to the vegetables. This research proposes three CNN-based models VGG-16, ResNet-152, and EfficientNet-B4, to classify tomato leaf diseases into normal of disease affected. The proposed research is conducted to find the best possible solution for detecting tomato leaf disease using these deep learning approaches. Employing the Plant-Village dataset with 5524 leaf images, ResNet-152 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved 93.75% and 97.27% accuracy respectively, while VGG-16 achieved 98% accuracy.

Indian farmers rely heavily on cotton as one of their main income crops. An in-depth analysis of the issue of agricultural production is crucial since a significant portion of the Indian economic structure is dependent on agricultural output. Because of the disease's invasion, cotton productivity decreases every year. Crop disease taxonomy and recognition have risen to its importance in the agricultural sector, both technically and economically. Cotton leaf disease detection is critical in preventing severe occurrences as soon as the disease is recognized. However, maintaining track of crop diseases using the assistance of professionals can be relatively inexpensive in farming areas. There is a need for a technique or instrument that can recognize diseases autonomously since it could revolutionize the surveillance of vast areas of crops and allow for the collection of plant leaflets. Thereby, image processing, deep learning, and machine learning methods can be useful in precisely recognizing cotton leaf diseases.

More production should be possible only with more people and land, but it is not possible. Farmers used to rely on word-of-mouth, but climate circumstances prevent them from doing so. Soil is one of the important factors in cultivating the crops. The new farmers are unaware about the crop which has to be cultivated in the particular season. To solve this problem, this system helps the farmer to know about the crop which has to be cultivated in the particular season to increase the production of the crops. Machine learning methods allow us to forecast the future and produce a precise model from the data. Agricultural issues like crop rotation, crop forecasting, water and fertilizer requirements, and crop protection can be solved. The need for an effective approach to simplify crop cultivation and the need to assist farmers in managing and producing their crops results from the environment’s unstable climatic conditions. This could enable aspiring farmers to practice better agriculture. With the aid of data mining, a farmer may be given a system of suggestions to aid in crop production. Crops are suggested for use in such a strategy depending on their quantity and meteorological considerations. The analysis of the crop dataset resulted in crop recommendations based on season, soil type, water and productivity. Various techniques like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are used in this system, which enable accuracy comparison and assist farmers in selecting the best crop under various situations.;;979-8-3503-3360-2;10.1109/ICSCSS57650.2023.10169320;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10169320;"Smart Farming;Linear Regression;Support Vector Regression (SVM);Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)";"Productivity;Support vector machines;Smart agriculture;Machine learning algorithms;Uncertainty;Linear regression;Crops";"agriculture;crops;data mining;fertilisers;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;soil;support vector machines";"agricultural crop;crop cultivation;crop dataset;crop forecasting;crop production;crop protection;crop recommendations;crop rotation;crops results;farmer;particular season;Tamil Nadu's productivity";;;;20;IEEE;7.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

When CPS devices are connected to a cloud server, big data streams generated by CPS devices impose enormous bandwidth pressure and exert excessive compute loads to the cloud server. Due to unpredictable environments and uncertainty in reality, these issues are mainly attributed to a large amount of high noise data captured and uploaded by CPS devices. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a cyber-physical-cloud based framework for distributed deep neural networks (DDNNs) to prevent high noise data from being uploaded to the cloud. The proposed framework features a lightweight data filtering module enabled by depthwise separable convolutions to identify and filter out the high noise data that the cloud cannot recognize. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data filtering module can achieve an accuracy of up to 83.72% in identifying high noise data and the proposed framework can effectively save bandwidth of up to 63.42% as compared to benchmarking methods. Note to Practitioners—This paper is motivated by the problems of enormous bandwidth pressure and excessive cloud compute loads in cyber-physical-cloud distributed computing paradigms. These problems are mainly caused by high noise data generated by CPS devices, because CPS devices often work in disturbing and unstable environments and there are uncontrollable uncertainties in reality. Especially for the emerging artificial intelligence-driven cyber-physical-cloud distributed paradigms, there is no existing research to solve the unnecessary transmission and cloud compute loads caused by high noise data. To tackle the challenge, this paper develops a novel cyber-physical-cloud distributed framework with data filtering capabilities to prevent high noise data from being uploaded. The proposed framework supports two popular loosely coupled and closely coupled distributed computing paradigms. Extensive experiments confirm that the proposed cyber-physical-cloud distributed framework can efficiently filter out high noise data and alleviate unnecessary transmission and needless cloud compute loads introduced by high noise data.;1558-3783;;10.1109/TASE.2022.3208027;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272169,61872147); Yunnan Academy of Tobacco Agriculture Sciences(grant numbers:2021530000241035); Innovation Fund of Chinese Universities Industry-University-Research(grant numbers:2019ITA02004); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908578;"Cyber-physical systems (CPS);distributed deep neural networks (DDNNs);high noise data;data filtering;bandwidth savings";"Neural networks;Distributed databases;Deep learning;Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Servers;Performance evaluation";"Big Data;cloud computing;convolutional neural nets;cyber-physical systems;deep learning (artificial intelligence)";"artificial intelligence-driven cyber-physical-cloud distributed paradigm;bandwidth pressure;big data streams;cloud compute load;cloud server;CPS application;CPS devices;cyber-physical-cloud distributed computing;DDNN;depthwise separable convolution;distributed deep neural networks;high noise data filtering;lightweight data filtering";;;;43;IEEE;3.10.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

This paper suggests a smart ground water recharge system that automatically recharges the ground water after rain falls. The system uses smart IOT devices, solar panels, and a filter to filter out unwanted materials that come along the rainwater. In this paper a fully automatic rainwater harvesting is introduced that collects rainwater and filters out dirt and unwanted materials(trash) that comes along the rain. It also senses the acidic content of rain and filters it out when needed.

Computer vision can assist farmers in timely locating and removing partial or even entire plants infested with pests, achieving pest control. However, the size and population density variance of paddy pests commonly cause interclass and intraclass differences in pest datasets, as well as an imbalance in hard samples. In addition, existing deep learning models struggle to balance compactness with high detection accuracy. This paper addresses these challenges by constructing the GPest14 dataset using FastGAN image generation technology, web crawlers, and manual selection. This is a large-scale rice pest dataset containing 14 categories suitable for training fine-grained visual detection tasks of rice pests. This work proposes the Fully Connected Bottleneck Transformer (FCBT) module, implants it into the tail of the YOLOv8n architecture backbone, and constructs the FCBTYOLO object detection model. Results indicate that the Gpest14 dataset increases by at least 12.2% in mean Average Precision (mAP) across major detection models. Simultaneously, our proposed FCBTYOLO model can achieve an average precision (mAP@50) of 93.6% with the network training weights constrained to a mere 6.7MB, and it only requires 16.8 milliseconds to detect a single pest image. FCBTYOLO has been validated on the large-scale public Pest24 dataset, where it can achieve a 1.1% improvement in mAP over the YOLOv8n model while maintaining the training weight at 8.3MB.

Deep learning (DL)-based plant disease identification using deep neural networks (DNN) has been successfully implemented in recent years. Recent work suggests DL models trained on lab-acquired image data do not generalize to similar accuracy levels for identifying diseases in the field. Additionally, most studies have not evaluated the generalizability of DL models for identifying plant diseases from various datasets and diverse imaging conditions. This study evaluates how well DL models generalize across different datasets and environmental conditions for identifying plant diseases using five datasets consisting of foliar disease images in corn: namely PlantVillage, PlantDoc, Digipathos, northern leaf blight (NLB) dataset, and a custom acquired CD&S dataset. Multiple DL-based image classification models were trained and evaluated using different dataset combinations. Transfer learning was utilized using five different pre-trained DNN architectures: InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, DesneNet169, and Xception, for conducting four different experiments. After training the models, images for distinct corn diseases from different datasets were used as testing data for evaluating the generalization ability of each DL model. It was observed that the DenseNet169 model performed the best. The highest generalization accuracy of 81.60% was observed when the DenseNet169 model was trained using red, green, blue, and alpha (RGBA) images from CD&S corn disease dataset with removed backgrounds.

However, precise and continuous spectral signatures, important for large-area crop growth monitoring and early prediction of yield production with cutting-edge algorithms, can be only provided via hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, this article used new-generation Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) images to classify the main crop types (hybrid corn, soybean, sunflower, and winter wheat) in Mez?hegyes (southeastern Hungary). A Wavelet-attention convolutional neural network (WA-CNN), random forest and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were utilized to automatically map the crops over the agricultural lands. The best accuracy was achieved with the WA-CNN, a feature-based deep learning algorithm and a combination of two images with overall accuracy (OA) value of 97.89% and the user's accuracy producer's accuracy was from 97% to 99%. To obtain this, first, factor analysis was introduced to decrease the size of the hyperspectral image data cube. A wavelet transform was applied to extract important features and combined with the spectral attention mechanism CNN to gain higher accuracy in mapping crop types.

Crop production forecast algorithms have been created using machine learning and deep learning techniques to handle this issue. Traditional machine learning techniques, however, are less effective because many characteristics related to meteorological data, earth data, and agricultural management data are dispersed and isolated to specific organization computers or smart farming devices. Using about 9,876 pictures, a collaborative learning CNN method for wheat disease identification is suggested. The suggested method used the federated averaging technique to train the model on laterally dispersed datasets across various client devices.

Similarly, identifying different species of bees and wasps can be challenging, especially for non-experts in the field. Therefore, developing a reliable and effective method for recognizing these animals is essential to reducing the issues caused by snake and insect attacks and supporting wildlife conservation efforts. The proposed method in this research utilizes deep ensemble learning and transfer learning techniques to identify snakes, wasps, and bees accurately. Deep ensemble learning involves combining several machine learning models to make better predictions, and transfer learning is a technique that allows pre-trained models to be re-used for new tasks, saving time and computational resources. The proposed method utilizes deep ensemble learning and uses three base transfer learning models, DenseNet201, MobileN etV2, and InceptionResN etV2, for classification. The study obtained a training accuracy of 93%. The research classified 11 types of snakes, four types of bees, and four types of wasps, including all 19 classes. Moreover, the author developed a mobile application for user interaction and utilized Flask API for the logic tier.

It might happen mostly as a result of not knowing how to identify and treat diseases that affect rice plants. Plant pathologists are looking for effective and trustworthy techniques to precisely identify and treat diseases affecting rice plants. Farmers still use outdated disease detection methods that require time-consuming visual examinations, leading to unsatisfactory farming operations. Through the use of methods like machine learning and deep learning, which garner a lot of attention in crop disease research, the detection of harmful organisms in rice plants has become substantially more controllable due to improvements in agricultural technology. For these classifications, there are numerous deep learning and machine learning models available, but the real challenge is to propose a method with higher accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Based on the Mandalay dataset of images, this study proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of four rice leaf diseases.

Implementing effective control measures for these diseases requires accurate and prompt identification. With a focus on the late blight and early blight of plant leaves, the researchers in this paper suggest a framework for categorizing plant diseases. Researchers have employed transfer learning strategies and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to construct a trustworthy and efficient disease categorization model. The suggested method uses a customized sequential model with well-known CNN algorithms for training and testing, such as ResNet-50, VGG16, VGG19, and the Sequential Model. With the pre-trained weights from these models, transfer learning is used to efficiently obtain features from the provided data. During training, a 30% dropout rate is used to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, the authors have acquired a substantial amount of data from potato leaves, including samples with early and late blight diseases. Experimental results depict that our suggested strategy using a sequential model has outperformed all other transfer learning algorithms and classifies potato leaf diseases with a good accuracy rate of 98.7% on testing data with 50 epochs, a batch size of 32, and a loss of 0.04.

Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the health of these trees. This study proposes an IoT-based tree monitoring system that can effectively guide and enhance the yield of sandalwood trees based on the type of soil. To collect data on the four crucial environmental factors that affect sandalwood growth, relative sensors are used to transmit the collected data via IoT. In order to detect the yield of crops, machine learning algorithms such as deep learning are proposed. This approach involves training a neural network to recognize patterns and predict crop yields based on various inputs. To achieve this, data are collected on various factors that can impact crop yield, such as weather conditions, soil quality, and irrigation. These data are used to train a deep learning model, which can then accurately predict crop yields based on these inputs. One of the main advantages of using deep learning for crop yield prediction is that it can account for complex relationships between different factors, such as the interaction between weather conditions and soil quality. This makes it a more accurate and reliable approach compared to traditional methods of yield prediction. Furthermore, once the deep learning model has been trained, it can be easily deployed to monitor crop yields in real-time, providing farmers with valuable insights and helping them to make more informed decisions. Overall, using deep learning to detect crop yields is a promising approach that can help farmers optimize their crop production and ultimately improve their profitability. The collected data is then forwarded to the server for analysis. A QR code can also be used to generate tree data, starting from the date of plantation until the present day.

The claim that potatoes are the most popular vegetable in the world, as made by a rising number of agricultural authorities, are taken into consideration by many countries. Despite the fanfare, potatoes are severely harmed by potato leaf diseases. Many different diseases, including early blight, late blight, and others, will attack potato plants and show their symptoms in the leaves. If these outbreaks are discovered at the beginning stage and timely treatment is considered, the farmer would not be at risk of suffering significant financial losses. The suggested model would effectively identify and diagnose potato leaf stand illnesses using image processing techniques. The Convolutional Neural Network model is utilized in this study to determine the disease from photos of the potato leaf. CNN is used for image classification and performs better than other algorithms in machine learning. These images are then examined using the algorithm provided, and the potato crop leaf is classified as either standard or unhealthy.

Image Enhancement Utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks for Improving the Accuracy of Pest Insect Classification;S. Khurana;Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Business and Technology, Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Punjab, India;2023 International Conference on Data Science and Network Security (ICDSNS);22.9.2023;2023;;;1;7;The accuracy of automated insect pest identification systems has been significantly improved with the advent of models based on deep neural networks in machine vision. To build a robust deep neural network categorization model, however, a large quantity of image data is required. It may be time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect and annotate massive datasets while creating image data. The purpose of this research is to cut down on the effort and time needed to do tasks like these. Insects' pest convolutional neural network (CNN) classification models are improved in this study by using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize training pictures from sticky paper trap photographs. uniform with little data, GAN was able to synthesis pictures to create a more uniform distribution and a larger pool of training images. When evaluating the quality of the synthetic pictures, t-SNE visualization was used as a test. The minimal needed number of pictures for applying GAN-based augmentation was calculated in order to test the constructed network. Classifier models for insect pests were also tested and compared across three augmentation scenarios: no augmentation, traditional augmentation, and GAN-based augmentation. Classifier models trained using GAN -enhanced photographs outperformed those trained with typically augmented photos on tests (F1-score, 0.95 vs. 0.92 respectively). This study demonstrates that insect-pest CNN classification algorithms may improve in performance by employing a GAN-based augmentation strategy instead of a traditional one, while also requiring less data gathering effort. When just a small number of images is available, the suggested method may be simply applied to a wide range of agricultural applications.;;979-8-3503-0159-5;10.1109/ICDSNS58469.2023.10245901;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10245901;"Image Augmentation;GAN Model;Insect Pest Classification model;CNN and Limited Dataset";"Training;Visualization;Insects;Machine vision;Data visualization;Network security;Generative adversarial networks";"agriculture;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image enhancement;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;pest control";"applying GAN-based augmentation;augmentation scenarios;automated insect pest identification systems;classifier models;constructed network;data gathering effort;deep neural networks;GAN -enhanced photographs;GAN-based augmentation strategy;generative adversarial network;image data;image enhancement utilizing generative adversarial networks;insect pests;insect-pest CNN classification algorithms;insects;pest insect classification;robust deep neural network categorization model;sticky paper trap photographs;synthesis pictures;synthetic pictures;traditional augmentation;training images;training pictures;typically augmented photos";;;;21;IEEE;22.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The number of people working in the agricultural sector is reducing daily, increasing the cost of manual labour. Localisation and pose estimation of the target fruit is central to any automation-based solution for fruit harvesting. These tasks can be challenging due to the occlusion caused by branches and leaves, as it limits the options to approach the target fruit. The efficacy of deep learning methods using RGB and 3D point cloud data has been demonstrated recently for grasp-pose estimation in dynamic situations. However, this process requires a large amount of data labelled using application-specific annotation tools. Data augmentation is a powerful and cost-effective solution for reducing the requirement for labelled data. In this paper, we propose an augmentation method, 3D-CopyPaste (3DCP), for augmenting point-cloud data for estimating the Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) grasp pose.

However, complex variations in building roofs that resemble the background of their surroundings pose challenges for deep-learning-based change detection methods due to their focus on color and texture. Additionally, downsampling can result in the loss of spatial information, leading to incomplete buildings and irregular output boundaries. To address these challenges, a novel Siamese network called AFDE-Net is proposed, which combines differential image features and attention modules using a learnable parameter. The AFDE-Net employs an ensemble spatial-channel attention fusion (ESCAF) module, along with a deep supervision (DS) module, to mitigate the loss of spatial information and refine deep features in high-dimensional inputs. Besides, we have created a new dataset (EGY-BCD) comprising high-resolution and multitemporal satellite images captured in four urban and coastal areas in Egypt to detect building changes. The EGY-BCD dataset includes images with complex types of change, such as tall and dense buildings with roofs that resemble the background of their surroundings, which is a challenge for deep-learning algorithms.

This paper proposes a prediction model grounded on Artificial intelligence techniques to predict the climate change effects on the Crop production. The proposed model is known as the Prediction Model for Climate Change Effects on Crop production (PMCCE). PMCCE utilizes the Artificial intelligence techniques along with the IoT technology to predict the crop production taking in consideration the climate change factors as: Annual Precipitation, Climate impacts per Celsius $\circ {C}$, Co2 concentrations, and temperature. The proposed model provides decision-makers with a comprehensive overview of the suitability of number of the most needed crops (namely, maize, wheat, and rice) for both short-term and long-term cultivation. An optimized Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is proposed in PMCCE to predict the most appropriate crop based on climate change data and to predict the most significant factors affecting crop production. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model efficiently predicts the most suitable crop that enhances yield production and is better suited to cultivation under specific climate change scenarios. Furthermore, PMCCE outperforms other prediction models that used different methods, as the accuracy of the PMCCE model for the three targeted crops, achieved 98.2%, 98.69%, and 98.1% for Wheat, Maize, and Rice, respectively.

However, the lack of a reliable and timely diagnosis system for identifying livestock diseases has led to significant losses in the livestock population, hindering efforts to achieve food security and reduce poverty in the country. To address this issue, a study proposed the integration of an expert system with machine learning and image processing. According to the 2019 Livestock Census, India has a total livestock population of around 535 million, which includes cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and pigs. The livestock sector is an important source of income for millions of households in India. As per the 2019 Livestock Census, there are around 145 million households involved in livestock farming and related activities in the country. The livestock sector contributes significantly to the Indian economy. In 2020, the total value of livestock output in India, excluding the value of horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, camels, and yak, was estimated to be around 9.37 trillion Indian rupees (around 125 billion US dollars), which accounts for around 4.2% of country's GDP. The dairy sector is a major contributor to the livestock economy in India. It accounts for around 70% of the total value of livestock output in the country. In addition to dairy, the livestock sector also provides meat, wool, leather, and other products. According to the latest available data from the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, the contribution of the livestock sector to India's Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2020–21 was 5.04%. Since GVA is more accurate measure of the sector's contribution to the economy than GDP, it is concluded that livestock sector contributed around 5% to India's economy in 2020–21. According to a study by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) of India, there is an average of one veterinarian for every 5,000 cattle in India. This study improves the accuracy of livestock disease diagnosis and minimize losses by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) integrated with LSTM and ResNet50 algorithms. This model analyzes uploaded livestock images and accurately identifies specific diseases, providing prompt information on the disease name, recommended medicine, and food recommendations. By offering quick and accurate diagnoses, proposed model has the potential to significantly improve the livestock industry in India and contribute to poverty reduction efforts. To further enhance the performance, data augmentation techniques is proposed to increase dataset diversity, transfer learning with pre-trained models to leverage existing knowledge, ensemble learning to combine multiple models' predictions, continuous model refinement through regular updates and collaborations with domain experts, and user feedback and usability testing to improve the system's user experience. Implementing these strategies will contribute to the ongoing development and effectiveness of the livestock disease diagnosis system, facilitating better health management and reduced losses in the livestock sector.;;979-8-3503-4757-9;10.1109/ICECAA58104.2023.10212385;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212385;"Livestock;Machine Learning;CNN (Convolutional Neural Network);RestNet50;LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)";"Image processing;Sociology;Predictive models;Agriculture;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Medical diagnosis";"convolutional neural nets;dairying;data analysis;data augmentation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;economic indicators;food products;food security;image enhancement;recurrent neural nets;user experience";"CNN;convolutional neural networks;country GDP;dairy sector;data augmentation;developing countries;ensemble learning;food security;health management;image processing;Indian economy;Indias gross value added;livestock disease diagnosis system;livestock economy;livestock farming;livestock images;livestock industry;livestock population;livestock sector;LSTM;machine learning;recommending medicines;ResNet50 algorithm;socioeconomic assets;transfer learning;user experience;veterinarian";;;;14;IEEE;16.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

However, its cultivation has substantial challenges, particularly pests and illnesses. Work must be done to stop the disease from spreading if these challenges are to be solved. Utilizing the symptoms and indicators detected on corn plant leaves, classifying leaf diseases is one technique to improve diagnosis accuracy. The CNN method has recently been used in research on classifying illnesses on corn leaves. The CNN method often employs the softmax loss (cross-entropy) loss function. A downside of the softmax loss is that there are significant intra-class variances. To reduce intra-class variances, the center loss is proposed. According to research, accuracy is higher when using a loss-fused convolutional neural network (LF-CNN), a CNN model that combines two separate loss functions (softmax loss and center loss) than when using a single softmax loss. As a result, the Loss-Fused Convolutional Neural Network (LF-CNN) approach was used in this study to carry out the classification.

Modern machine learning approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However, most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc. Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label (Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves better accuracy and F1-score.

The results of recent research suggest that radiological images include important information related to COVID-19 and other chest diseases. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) to assist in the automated diagnosis of chest diseases may prove useful as a diagnostic tool in the future. In this study, we propose a novel fusion model of hand-crafted features with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for classifying ten different chest diseases such as COVID-19, lung cancer (LC), atelectasis (ATE), consolidation lung (COL), tuberculosis (TB), pneumothorax (PNET), edema (EDE), pneumonia (PNEU), pleural thickening (PLT), and normal using chest X-rays (CXR). The method that has been suggested is split down into three distinct parts. The first step involves utilizing the Info-MGAN network to perform segmentation on the raw CXR data to construct lung images of ten different chest diseases. In the second step, the segmented lung images are fed into a novel pipeline that extracts discriminatory features by using hand-crafted techniques such as SURF and ORB, and then these extracted features are fused to the trained DCNNs. At last, various machine learning (ML) models have been used as the last layer of the DCNN models for the classification of chest diseases. Comparison is made between the performance of various proposed architectures for classification, all of which integrate DCNNs, key point extraction methods, and ML models. We were able to attain a classification accuracy of 98.20% for testing by utilizing the VGG-19 model with a softmax layer in conjunction with the ORB technique.

Here, in this work, the Random Forest (RF) regression is chosen as the machine learning model for yield prediction. The data used in this work were collected from the aeroponic lettuce farming tower. The purpose of the research work is to investigate the potential of the random forest model for efficient prediction of the lettuce crop yield in aeroponics system.

First, limited high-dimensional HSI training examples exacerbate the difficulty of deep learning methods in learning effective spatial and spectral representations. Second, the existing CNN-based methods model local relations and present limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. In this paper, we customize a novel dual-stream Transformer (DSTrans) for HSI restoration, which mainly consists of the dual-stream attention and the dual-stream feed-forward network. Specifically, we develop the dual-stream attention consisting of Multi-Dconv-head spectral attention (MDSA) and Multi-head Spatial self-attention (MSSA). MDSA and MSSA respectively calculate self-attention along the spectral and spatial dimensions in local windows to capture long-range spectrum dependencies and model global spatial interactions. Meanwhile, the dual-stream feed-forward network is developed to extract global signals and local details in parallel branches. In addition, we exploit a multi-tasking network to train the auxiliary RGB image (RGBI) task and HSI task jointly so that both numerous RGBI samples and limited HSI samples are exploited to learn parameter distribution for DSTrans. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on HSI restoration tasks, including HSI super-resolution and denoising.

MORGAN seeks to generate class-conditioned adversarial samples for both the closed and open spaces in the few-shot regime using two GANs by judiciously tuning noise variance while ensuring discriminability using a novel Anti-Overlap Latent (AOL) regularizer. Adversarial samples from low noise variance amplify known class data density, and we use samples from high noise variance to augment ""known-unknowns"". A first-order episodic strategy is adapted to ensure stability in the GAN training.

Over 60 % of the population is employed in the field of agriculture.Rice is one of the significant staple crops in India. The most prominent hurdle farmer faces are disease identification which affects the crop and reduces yield significantly. Northeast monsoon dropped more than 57% rainfall in Tamil Nadu by 2021, and the Rice crop diseases like Blast, False Smut, Bacterial Leaf Blight, and Brown Spot emerged, which caused a 33% loss in the year 2021. The dataset is collected from the rice field of Chengalpattu district affected by this Northeast monsoon and from Kaggle, UCI Machine learning repository. Early prediction can reduce these losses and increase the quality and yield of the crops. The advancements in computer vision technology can do this with one precise algorithm in deep learning perfected with time: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN with feature extraction techniques is deployed to classify the diseases early. The different CNN models are trained to classify images into five classifications of diseases i) Blast, ii) Bacterial leaf blight, iii) Brown spot, iv) False smut, v) Tungro, and one classification of healthy crops. When the trained CNN models are deployed in a mobile hand-held device, the size of the CNN model is a significant obstacle. ResNet family CNN models give the highest output accuracy but come at the cost of increased computational resources. In this research, different dense CNN models and MobileNet models are proposed, which give comparable results to ResNet models but take much fewer computational resources.;;979-8-3503-3600-9;10.1109/ICNWC57852.2023.10127388;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127388;"Convolutional Neural Networks;Image Recognition;Feature Extraction;Deep Learning;Rice Disease Identification.";"Deep learning;Microorganisms;Computational modeling;Sociology;Crops;Monsoons;Predictive models";"agriculture;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;mobile computing;plant diseases;product quality;resource allocation";"agriculture;bacterial leaf blight;Blast;Brown Spot;Chengalpattu district;computational resources;computer vision;convolutional neural network;crop quality;crop yield;deep learning;dense CNN model;disease classification;False Smut;feature extraction;healthy crops;image classification;India;Kaggle;mobile handheld device;MobileNet model;northeast monsoon;ResNet family CNN model;resource prudent CNN models;rice crop disease identification;rice field;staple crops;Tamil Nadu;Tungro;UCI Machine learning repository";;1;;34;IEEE;25.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Rice seedling raising is to sow after germination. During the seed cultivation process, it will produce different characteristics and thus affect the seedling development or sowing effect. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of rice seed target detection of rice pot floppy disk hole seeding amount, this paper proposes a method of rice pot floppy disk hole seeding amount detection based on depth learning. The production data set should use the pictures taken from the seeded floppy disk on the top to train the network on the GPU computing platform by using the data set through the YOLOv5 neural network model. The analysis of the training results and the verification results show that the trained neural network model is a very suitable network model for the detection of the amount of rice seeds planted in holes in terms of real-time and other comprehensiveness.

As a result, individuals suffer losing their possessions, cattle, crops, and occasionally even their lives. This is due to the animals that cross roads without any conscious to the vehicles that pass the roads. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the different types of animals that are been found at roadsides. Manual identification of animals crossing roads are a difficult task. To overcome this difficulty the paper suggests a classification technique using DCNN deep learning technique and ResNet152V2 algorithm, which classifies the type of animal based on their images. After classification a notification is sent using a Wi-Fi enabled IOT device through a web application software called Blynk, which controls Arduino board with smart phone via internet.

Early detection of such pests can largely help farmers to plan a proper mechanism to fight them and reduce the damage or the orchard. This paper primarily focuses on the early detection of mealybugs in custard apples. A mealybug is a cotton-like bug that inhibits the exterior of the fruit and feeds on the fruit sap. This not only reduces the nutrition of the fruit but also makes fruit look unpleasant thus reducing its market price. Many models including CNN, Random Forest, Xgboost, and SVM have been implemented on the collected dataset. The system developed is able to differentiate mealybugs on green custard apples and classify them as infected or uninfected.

In the marketplace, where prediction of fruits, vegetables, and pulses by retailers and the general public is very difficult. In this paper, we have recognised two different classes of fruits, vegetables, and pulses and categorised them based on the stages of their existence and maturity in a procedure called fruit maturity classification. Crop distribution, good fruit counts, crop harvesting, crop disease detection, weed management, and production forecasting are all aspects of managing water and soil and are just a few of the smart agricultural applications that employ robust learning (DL). The finest deep learning is what this project seeks to produce in algorithms for estimating fruit quality and ripeness in order to forecast fruit shelf life. Manual vegetable and fruit detection is a hard process when done in large numbers, but it becomes easy when done in small amounts. Automated detection of these is thus used. Fruit, crop, and pulse images served as the input for the first stage of processing, which included detection. Background removal, extraction of colour and texture properties, and categorization comprised the three steps of the process. The K-means clustering method was used for background subtraction. Statistical attributes were used to pinpoint colour characteristics.

Traditionally, there are ways on how to detect these hoppers such as plant flapping which causes a less accurate and tedious way of surveying planthoppers densities. Nowadays, there are modern technologies that help agricultural sciences to build and develop advanced crop management protection. With this advancement, surveying and detecting planthoppers may bring a more accurate and simple way of planthopper detection. In this study, computer visualization such as image recognition and machine learning is applied. Detection of the planthopper is done using an image processing technique such as downsizing the images and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Images were collected in rice fields where rice plants nearly at the harvest stage. Processed images attained a 93.74% accuracy rate of the detected specific planthopper in collected images. With the help of this modern technology of surveying the density of the planthoppers in rice crop farming, detection of such insects is easier and more accurate and it would be helpful for the agricultural sector to deliver an abrupt possible solution to prevent the damages that planthoppers may bring to the rice crops such as hopper burn.

As humans are involved, there is a higher potential of mistakes occurring, and farmers may receive inaccurate reports. The necessity to automate the process results from this. The purpose of soil testing is to identify the soil's fertility factor and, consequently, the best crop to farm for maximum yield. This prompted the development of software that estimates the soil's amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) after first calculating several soil fertility variables like moisture, electrical conductivity, pH, and others.

In order to increase productivity, we have been developing a system to remotely monitor the growth of Nototemari using LoRa. LoRa is an important technology for cost reduction, but the bandwidth is narrow and a lot of data cannot be sent. To reduce the amount of information transmitted over LoRa, we proposed a method to reduce the resolution of the areas outside of the Nototemari using AI image recognition. However, it is difficult to know the actual size with this method, and it has been said that a method for confirming size information to measure the degree of growth is needed. Therefore, this paper proposes a system that measures the 3D size of Nototemari using edge computing and sends the data from greenhouse to the office using LoRa.

The majority of individuals in India, whether driven by inherited customs or conscious environmental considerations, choose farming as their primary occupation. The knowledge of cultivating lands or growing crops has been transferred from their ancestors. These farmers who generally stay in the rural part of India don't have any guidance or knowledge that helps their occupation grow healthy crops and achieve greater crop yields. Farmers commonly engage in the repetitive cultivation of crops year after year, following a consistent pattern of crop types and utilizing identical fertilizers. Unfortunately, this practice leads to the depletion of essential nutrients and minerals necessary for cultivating robust and thriving crops. Farmers struggle to find the right disease and often don't know which product is better to grow at which season based on environmental factors. Farmers encounter several challenges and obstacles in their profession. However, accessing information at their fingertips remains the most effective and efficient means for farmers to acquire knowledge in today's digital age. This research focuses on a procedure designed to assist farmers in determining the most suitable crop for their specific location, while also providing them with valuable information regarding crop diseases related and recommendations for appropriate fertilizers. The system incorporates a community section where farmers can post and update crop-related issues, enabling anyone to view and offer suggestions to address the problems.

To address this, we introduce the YOLOv5-LNH model for tea bud detection in natural environments, building upon the YOLOv5-S model's foundation. In pursuit of heightened detection speed, we eliminate the YOLOv5-S model's large object detection head and meticulously fine-tune the parameters of the neck network, thereby significantly reducing redundant model parameters. Our evaluation of the YOLOv5-LNH model employs a real-world tea bud dataset. The test outcomes unmistakably indicate that the YOLOv5-LNH model achieves a remarkably faster detection speed in contrast to the YOLOv5-S model. Operating at 135 FPS, the YOLOv5-LNH model showcases a 25% enhancement over its predecessor, while upholding a commendable mAP of 89.8%—a mere 0.8% decrease from the YOLOv5-S model.

Various user behavior data is constantly accumulated, and learning content is constantly enriched, thus forming a variety of learning materials. The current learning platform provides basically the same content for each student, which fails to provide differentiated resources for personalized needs. How to find personalized learning resources to meet the needs of students in the massive educational resources data has become an urgent problem to be solved in the field of education. How to help learners find educational resources that meet their needs from massive learning resources, help learners make up for knowledge defects and avoid repeating the content they have mastered, and cultivate learners’ knowledge system have become the focus of educational resource recommendation research.

The loss of agricultural economy and losses in the community are therefore significantly influenced by diseases in the paddy plant. It is very difficult for the farmers to detect and recognize the various symptoms and diseases in paddy. So, the major challenge is how one can effectively control the diseases by detecting the symptoms earlier. Keeping this challenge in mind this paper proposes a better and effective solution for the detection and identification of diseases in paddy plants using machine learning techniques. In recent times SVM, K-NN, A-NN and CNN are some of the popular approaches used in similar kind of studies. According to researches done all these techniques have certain demerits. SVM are not suitable in large datasets, for K-NN the computation cost is high, in A-NN approach, training examples may contain errors and training data is noisy and CNN faces the challenge of overfitting. The team has proposed a model for paddy plant disease detection using the CNN approach with MobileNetV2 and transfer learning technique that will classify the diseases from the photos captured with an accuracy of 99.98%. The model focuses on Training more data and Data Augmentation to combat the challenge of overfitting. Previously it took many iterations or epochs to train the complete model and to achieve a high accuracy. In this case it will take only five to eight iteration or epochs to achieve a superb accuracy.

To guarantee the healthy and proper growth of the rice plants, it is essential to identify any illness early on and before the damaged plants receive the required treatment. Having an automated approach makes sense because manually detecting diseases takes a lot of time and effort. This article describes a method that uses machine learning to identify illnesses in rice leaves. Four of the most common diseases impacting rice plants are Blast, Bacterial Leaf Blight, Tungro, and Brown Spot, according to this study. The input consisted of clear pictures of damaged rice leaves. Following the appropriate pre-processing, a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, J48, REP Tree was trained on the dataset. After 10-fold cross-validation, the decision tree method produced results on the test dataset with an accuracy of above 94%.;2473-7577;979-8-3503-4821-7;10.1109/ICCCI56745.2023.10128283;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128283;"Random Forest;J48;REPTree;Peformance measures;Rice diseases";"Plant diseases;Machine learning algorithms;Microorganisms;Biological system modeling;Forestry;Feature extraction;Decision trees";"agriculture;crops;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;plant diseases;random forests";"common diseases;damaged plants;damaged rice leaves;healthy growth;illness;nutritional demands;proper growth;random forest;REP tree;rice leaves;rice plant diseases;rice plants;supervised machine learning algorithms";;;;8;IEEE;24.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Recent advances have demonstrated that this problem can be effectively solved by using a deep architecture based on the multi-layer perceptron, where the context normalization is designed to make the network permutation-equivariant and embed global information in the sparse point data. However, the context normalization simply normalizes the feature maps according to their distribution and treats each correspondence equally, leading to difficulties in adequately capturing scene geometry encoded by the inliers, especially in case of severe outliers. To address this issue, this paper designs a context-sensitive network based on the self-attention mechanism, termed as correspondence attention transformer (CAT), to enhance the consistent geometry information of inliers and simultaneously suppress outliers during embedding global information. In particular, we design an attention-style structure to aggregate features from all correspondences, i.e., a spatial attention namely CAT-S, which provides each correspondence with information exchange from others in the putative set. To capture the contextual information in a more comprehensive and robust way, we also introduce a multi-head mechanism in our structure to exploit the geometrical context from different aspects. Moreover, considering the high memory request in spatial attention, we propose a covariance normalized channel attention CAT-C in our framework, which can largely reduce the memory consumption and parameter scale, but it asks for eigenvalue decomposition in each attention block thus resulting in more runtime. Anyway, these two attention mechanisms can realize information exchange from the spatial or channel aspect, which both contribute to constructing the geometrical context between inliers and encourage the network to pay more attention to the feature subset about potential inliers. Extensive experiments have been conducted over both indoor and outdoor datasets on the tasks of camera pose estimation, outlier removal, and image registration, which demonstrate the superiority of our method that realizes a large performance improvement compared with the current state-of-the-art approaches.;1941-0077;;10.1109/TMM.2022.3162115;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072223,61972093); Key Research and Development Program of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020BAB113); Natural Science Fund of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2019CFA037); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9741369;"Feature matching;deep learning;context-sensitive;self-attention";"Task analysis;Feature extraction;Transformers;Memory management;Information exchange;Geometry;Cameras";"cameras;computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature extraction;geometry;image registration;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pose estimation";"adequately capturing scene geometry;attention block;attention mechanisms;attention-style structure;channel attention CAT-C;computer vision;consistent geometry information;context normalization;context-sensitive network;contextual information;correspondence attention transformer;deep architecture;feature maps;fundamental problem;geometrical context;global information;information exchange;multihead mechanism;multilayer perceptron;network permutation-equivariant;potential inliers;putative correspondences;putative set;self-attention mechanism;severe outliers;sparse point data;spatial attention;spatial channel aspect;two-view correspondence learning";;5;;67;IEEE;24.3.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Therefore, achieving maximum production results is a challenge faced by professional growers, who have seen greenhouses as a very good option to guarantee these results. By using new technologies inside greenhouses, farmers can reduce the damaging effect of insects on plants and improve indoor cultivation through climate control. However, to efficiently manage agricultural fields and greenhouses today, farmers have to apply technologies in line with Industry 4.0, such as: robots, Internet of Things devices, machine learning applications, and so on. In this context, deploying sensors plays a key role in collecting data and finding information supporting the farmer’s decision-making. As a feasible solution for small farms, this paper presents an autonomous robot that moves through greenhouse crop paths with previously-planned routes and can collect environmental data provided by a wireless sensor network, where the farmer does not have previous information about the crop. Here, an unsupervised learning algorithm is implemented to cluster the optimal, standard, and deficient sectors of a greenhouse to determine inappropriate growth patterns in crops. Finally, a user interface is designed to help farmers plan both the route and distance to be traveled by the robot while collecting information from the sensors to observe crop conditions.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3283986;"Novo Nordisk Fonden(grant numbers:NNF20OC0064411); Corporacion Ecuatoriana para el Desarrollo de la Investigacion y la Academia (CEDIA), Ecuador(grant numbers:CEPRA XII-2018-13); Universidad de Las Americas (UDLA), Quito, Ecuador(grant numbers:IEA.WHP.21.02); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10146280;"Smart farming robot;environmental monitoring;applications of intelligent sensors;integrated sensors;the Internet of Things";"Climate change;Smart agriculture;Internet of Things;Environmental monitoring;Sensors;Intelligent sensors;Robots;Crops;Food production";"agricultural products;agriculture;crops;decision making;greenhouses;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks";"agricultural fields;agricultural production;autonomous robot;climate change;climate control;countries;crop conditions;environmental conditions;environmental data;farmer;finding information;greenhouse crop paths;insect infestation;machine learning applications;maximum production results";;1;;53;CCBYNCND;8.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

We study two approaches: 1) offline detection running on the orthophoto of the area scanned within the mission and 2) real-time scanning from the frame stream directly on the edge device performing the flight mission. We show that by fusing the information from an additional multispectral camera installed on the drone, there is an opportunity to boost the detection quality, which can then be preserved even with a single RGB camera setup by the introduction of an additional convolution neural network trained with transfer learning to produce the fake multispectral images directly from the RGB stream. We show that this approach helps either eliminate the multispectral hardware from the drone or, if only the RGB camera is at hand, boost the segmentation performance by the cost of slight increase in computational budget. To support this claim, we have performed an extensive study of network performance in simulations of both the real-time and offline modes, where we achieve at least 1.1% increase in terms of the mean intersection over union metric when evaluated on the RGB stream from the camera and 1.4% when evaluated on orthophoto data. Our results show that the proper optimization guarantees a complete elimination of the multispectral camera from the flight mission by adding a preprocessing stage to the segmentation network without the loss of quality.;2151-1535;;10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3224657;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9963605;"Deep learning;edge computing;semantic segmentation;transfer learning";"Cameras;Monitoring;Satellites;Task analysis;Computer architecture;Agriculture;Streaming media";"agriculture;cameras;geophysical image processing;image colour analysis;image segmentation;image sensors;infrared imaging;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;spectral analysis";"convolution neural network;detection quality;drone;edge device;embedded image processing;fake multispectral images;flight mission;frame stream;hogweed detection;multispectral camera;multispectral cameras;multispectral hardware;network performance;offline modes;orthophoto data;real-time scanning;RGB stream;segmentation network;segmentation performance;single RGB camera setup;transfer learning";;;;39;CCBY;24.11.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

The progress of farming as a whole has been greatly influenced by advancements in plant physiology. Use of organic and mineral fertilizers has been rationalized. A scientific rationale for the necessity of irrigation has been developed via studies of the soil and plant water requirements. When the right conditions, such as the right temperature, humidity, sunlight, moisture, nutrients, etc. were present, these developments led to an increase in the soil's effective fertility, which in turn contributed to boost crop output. Crops are chosen based on the quality of the soil and the climate. The suggested agro method helps farmers identify the type of soil with the aid of sensors that can measure the soil's moisture content, pH level, and nutrient content (NPK). The farmer will be able to choose the right crops to plant with the aid of these values. Crop selection should be based on a number of parameters, including the kind of soil, its texture, and its nutrient content. The major goal is to increase plant health while simultaneously lowering excessive water use. It must guarantee that the crops are not over-or under-irrigated. Building a water supply system that will consider the soil's moisture content and disperse water as the soil requires can solve this issue, without harming the crop and without using excessive amounts of water. We can continuously check the amount of water in the soil by utilising inexpensive sensors. When the water level drops and crosses a certain threshold, the sensors will trigger a sprinkler or a pump that is connected to it, providing water to the crops. This arrangement will assist small-scale farmers in increasing crop yields, which will boost the Indian economy. The IoT module has sensors for soil moisture, temperature, pH, and NPK that collect data in real time and upload it to a cloud storage. Then, pre-trained models created using machine learning methods will be compared with the real-time sensed data. The Sensor Information Unit, which is connected to the secure cloud storage, receives data from the deployed sensors. A machine learning algorithm will be utilised to anticipate the appropriate crops that can be produced in that particular soil utilising the data obtained by the cloud for data analysis. The machine learning module will additionally predict when fertilisers will need to be applied and how precise monitoring will result in a high crop yield.;;979-8-3503-3324-4;10.1109/ICCPCT58313.2023.10245248;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10245248;;"Temperature sensors;Smart agriculture;Cloud computing;Machine learning algorithms;Soil moisture;Crops;Machine learning";"agriculture;cloud computing;crops;data analysis;fertilisers;Internet of Things;investment;irrigation;learning (artificial intelligence);moisture;plant diseases;productivity;soil;water supply";"appropriate crops;climatic conditions;crop output;crop selection;crop yields;crosses;disperse water;excessive water use;farmer;high crop production;high crop yield;increase plant health;IoT based secure smart farming;mineral fertilizers;moisture content;nutrient content;organic fertilizers;particular soil;plant physiology;plant water requirements;possible labour investment;soil moisture;water level drops;water supply system";;;;7;IEEE;22.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Recognizing the need for an effective advisory support system for small-scale farmers, the ‘Farmer Support System’ has been developed This web-based project provides farmers with access to essential information and resources to aid in their agricultural practices. In this paper, the researchers describe the various features incorporated into the system. To develop a web based farmer support system, Node, Express.js and Flask have been utilized as back-end tools, and HTML, CSS, EJS view engine, and JavaScript are used for front-end development. The system retrieves data through communication with two Python dictionaries that hold information on crops and fertilizers. Unlike many current recommendation systems, such as “Crop Prediction using Machine Learning” by Kalimuthu, M, P. Vaishnavi, and M. Kishore (2020), the proposed application not only predicts the most suitable crop for a farmer's plot, but also provides detailed guidance on the cultivation process. The system also allows users to search for information on any crop, predict the most appropriate fertilizer for their farm and provides real-time chat support to address any queries they may have.

AgTech Adoption for Irrigation Systems: A Review;"A. Ranjan; D. Gupta";"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dr. B.R.

Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, Punjab, India";2023 Third International Conference on Secure Cyber Computing and Communication (ICSCCC);14.7.2023;2023;;;809;814;Agriculture is the backbone of our country's economy, and irrigation is the major phase of agriculture throughout the crop life cycle and crop production. Many scientists and scholars are breaking their necks to hatch legitimate solutions in contemplation of enhancing the efficiency of water used for irrigation. This could be achieved using various AgTech adoption strategies. As per an estimate, around 70 percent of the freshwater on earth is consumed specifically for irrigation purposes. To reinforce the efficiency of freshwater management and slash water wastage in the act of irrigation, further advancements are being made in this field. It takes into consideration several environmental parameters, most commonly humidity, temperature, and soil moisture, thereby impacting crop production and water management simultaneously. The present paper reviews much of this research that incorporates the use of various IoT devices, such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, actuators, etc., together as a system for optimizing water requirements and usage. But deploying sensors in the field and collecting data takes considerable time, cost, and effort. To agree upon that, the paper has proposed the use of evapotranspiration as a parameter to measure water loss from crop fields. To calculate evapotranspiration using weather parameters, it is suggested to use the FAO 56 Penman-Monteith equation (PME). PME is considered a standard empirical method for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration. This method can further be used to measure the crop water requirements based on the crop coefficient of any particular crop. Also, machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) models can be used for the predictive analysis of evapotranspiration. Thus, empirical as well as DL/ML models can replace the IoT-based models, or they can reduce the cost of existing IoT models by working simultaneously.;;979-8-3503-0071-0;10.1109/ICSCCC58608.2023.10176798;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10176798;"irrigation;microcontrollers;sensors;actuators;IoT;ML/DL;agriculture;evapotranspiration";"Temperature sensors;Irrigation;Costs;Computational modeling;Crops;Production;Mathematical models";"agricultural engineering;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);evaporation;Internet of Things;irrigation;moisture;soil;transpiration;water resources";"agriculture;AgTech adoption strategies;crop coefficient;crop fields;crop life cycle;crop production;crop water requirements;efficiency 70.0 percent;evapotranspiration;FAO 56 Penman-Monteith equation;freshwater management;irrigation purposes;irrigation systems;water loss;water management;water wastage;weather parameters";;;;23;IEEE;14.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

While the potentials of Convolutional Neural Networks for detection, classification and segmentation tasks have successfully been demonstrated in other application areas, this relatively new field currently lacks the required quantity and quality of training data for such a highly data-driven approach. Therefore, we propose a novel large-scale image dataset specializing in the fine-grained identification of 74 relevant crop and weed species with a strong emphasis on data variability. We provide annotations of labeled bounding boxes, semantic masks and stem positions for about 112k instances in more than 8k high-resolution images of both real-world agricultural sites and specifically cultivated outdoor plots of rare weed types. Additionally, each sample is enriched with an extensive set of meta-annotations regarding environmental conditions and recording parameters. We furthermore conduct benchmark experiments for multiple learning tasks on different variants of the dataset to demonstrate its versatility and provide examples of useful mapping schemes for tailoring the annotated data to the requirements of specific applications. In the course of the evaluation, we furthermore demonstrate how incorporating multiple species of weeds into the learning process increases the accuracy of crop detection.

Root-zone Soil Moisture Nowcasting using Context Aware Machine Learning;"A. F. Aktas; B. B. Üstünda?";"Informatics Institute, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey; Faculty of Computer and Informatics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey";2023 11th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics);1.9.2023;2023;;;1;5;Estimation of root-zone soil moisture (SM) is crucial for effective agricultural management and water resource planning. However, current methods for soil moisture estimation exhibit several limitations that hinder their practical application. This study introduces a novel nowcasting model, which integrates in-situ and remote sensing data through a Predictive Error Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork (PECNET), addressing the drawbacks of existing approaches.Existing SM estimation techniques often suffer from limited accuracy, inadequate contextual information, and no real-time monitoring capabilities. Although remote sensing technologies offer promising advantages, such as wide spatial coverage and frequent data acquisition, they are not immune to limitations. Vegetation coverage and density present challenges in accurately estimating root-zone SM using remote sensing techniques. These factors can introduce uncertainties and errors in the estimation process, thereby impacting the reliability of the results.To overcome these limitations and enhance the accuracy of root-zone SM estimation, this study proposes the integration of remote sensing data with in-situ measurements. Specifically, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculations from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites are fused with evapotranspiration and rainfall data obtained from agrometeorological stations. Combining these datasets generates an 8-day time series for the target parcels, leveraging the contextual information provided by NDVI and seasonality to improve the accuracy of root-zone soil moisture estimation.To develop a robust and efficient model, we introduce PECNET, which ensures the orthogonality of input features and facilitates the learning of non-linear relationships between variables. Notably, PECNET addresses the challenge of limited labeled training data, minimizing the risk of overfitting and enabling accurate estimation with fewer labeled samples. In addition, this study employs discrete wavelet transformation coefficients as inputs for the neural networks, demonstrating superior performance compared to direct measurements.Validation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed PECNET model. Comparative analyses with simple regression, Kriging, and feed-forward neural networks reveal the significant advantages of the Predictive Error Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork approach in root-zone soil moisture estimation.In conclusion, this research introduces an advanced nowcasting model for root-zone SM estimation. By integrating in-situ and remote sensing data, harnessing contextual information, and utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, our approach overcomes the limitations of existing methods. It offers a robust solution for accurate soil moisture estimation, with implications for precision agriculture, water management, and decision-making related to agricultural practices and land resource utilization.

Early detection of leaf blight disease in plants allows proper protection to avoid the widespread of the disease. The general objective of this study was to design and develop a leaf blight detection system using image processing and a motion sensor with a laser tripwire alert system to detect intrusion and send SMS alerts. The data were randomly divided into three portions, with 75% being allocated as the training dataset, 22% as validation, and 3% as testing. The YOLOv5 object detection model was trained to detect leaf blight disease, resulting in a mean average precision of 38.80% (mAP 0.5) and 13.3% (mAP 0.5:0.95), with a precision of 56% and a recall of 37.90%.

Significant advancements have been made in complex and rule-intensive natural language processing through deep learning, in which machines directly learn patterns. Machine reading comprehension, a natural language processing task, involves machines understanding questions and paragraphs to find answers within paragraphs. In 2019, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and a robust optimized BERT pretraining approach (RoBERTa) were introduced. They were then optimized for pretraining and fine-tuning, resulting in significant advancements. RoBERTa outperformed BERT in terms of training speed and performance by increasing the pretraining data and batch sizes, employing dynamic masking, and eliminating the next sentence prediction task. In RoBERTa, machine reading comprehension involves simultaneously inputting questions and paragraphs. However, this simultaneous input method suffers from the attention separate representation (ASP) problem, in which the attention distribution between the question and the paragraph spreads widely across keywords. This study proposed two methods to address the ASP problem. The existing input format, question-paragraph, was changed to three independent inputs: question, paragraph, and concatenated RoBERTa outputs. The concatenated matrix was then transformed into two matrices, and a machine reading comprehension algorithm using co-attention was proposed. An ablation study was conducted to evaluate and analyze the model’s performance, comprehension, and design efficiency. According to the experimental results, the proposed method improved the EM by 0.9% and F1 by 1.0% compared to the existing methods. Consequently, the learning performance was enhanced through attention concentration and co-attention, and it could demonstrate much better performance compared to the existing models.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3328352;"Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture and Forestry (IPET) through the Smart Farm Innovation Technology Development Program funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA); Rural Development Administration (RDA); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:421028-3); 2022 Cultural Technology Research and Development Project funded by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Creative Content Agency(grant numbers:R2022020014); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10299620;"Machine reading comprehension;attention mechanism;attention concentration;co-attention;RoBERTa";"Encoding;Training;Dispersion;Bidirectional control;Artificial intelligence;Indexes;Mathematical models;Information processing;Cognitive systems;Natural language processing";;;;;;29;CCBYNCND;30.10.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

However, it is labor-intensive to timely record and count the flowers. An optional method is to identify and count cucumber flowers automatically using computer vision technologies based on images taken by cameras installed in greenhouses. However, there are severe problems in images taken with a large field of view in a greenhouse environment, that is, foreground-background imbalance, which renders significant gaps between the detection accuracy and the application requirements even for state-of-the-art computer vision models like Faster-RCNN, SSD and YOLO. This problem can be improved by providing specific datasets and suitable models. Hence, in this paper, two cucumber flower datasets with a wide and medium field of view in greenhouses are constructed. Four attention mechanisms: SE, CA, CBAM and SimAM, are compared and incorporated into YOLOv5s algorithm to improve the detection performance of cucumber flowers during growing states in the greenhouse. The results indicated that our improved model with a SE attention mechanism reached the highest recognition rate than other three methods. The AP@.5 value of the YOLOv5s-SE7 model reached 0.905, which was 3.5% higher than that of the benchmark model YOLOv5s. Meanwhile, it outperformed other state-of-the-art methods such as Faster-RCNN and SSD.

Monitoring disease phenology is one of the possible ways to save agricultural products from huge yield loss incurred due to diseases. Rice is one of the major food crops across the globe. Leaf blast disease in rice affects its productivity all over the world. Monitoring of leaf blast is essential for strategic and tactical disease management decisions. Conventional methods of large-scale disease monitoring are laborious, time taking, and above all, suffer from inaccuracy. Remote sensing parameters are useful for monitoring diseases and crop health on a large scale. Spectral indices derived from remote sensing data provide characteristic features to distinguish areas between healthy and infected crops facilitating strategic application. Assessment of leaf blast incidence based on land surface temperature moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and moisture stress (Sentinel-2) have been used to predict disease patterns.

Computer vision technologies have begun to be used for fruit grade classification, and this is a major topic of interest in agricultural automation. However, because insufficient fruit grade classification accuracy is achieved with these technologies, manual processing must be performed. The accuracy of fruit grade classification can be enhanced using a Mask R-CNN, SPP-Net, and specific background processing. The designed mango grade classification system contains four modules: 1) a user interface module, 2) an object detection module, 3) an image preprocessing module, and 4) a fruit grade classification module. A camera is used to capture images of mangoes for display on the user interface. The object segmentation module generates a mango shape mask and bounding box by using a Mask R-CNN. The image preprocessing module uses the generated bounding box and mango shape mask to crop the mango and color the background blue. Finally, AlexNet–SPP-Net outputs the fruit grade. We validated the proposed approach by implementing it in mango grade classification and comparing its accuracy with that of relevant existing methods from the literature.

Four convolutional layers, 4 maximum-pooling layers, and two completely interconnected layers make up the model. A collection of labeled bean leaf photos was collected and prepared to train and test the model. The convolutional layers enable relevant characteristics and disease-specific patterns to be extracted from the photos. The maximum pooling layers aided in minimizing dimensions and focused on critical information. The completely connected layers performed pattern mapping and prediction at the highest level. The accuracy, recall, F1-score, encouragement, and accuracy measures showed that the model performed well in disease categorization.

There are many factors that impact the quality and quantity of crop yields, and environmental changes such as weather conditions require careful consideration and quick action to avoid significant losses. When it comes to managing fruit orchards, large areas need to be monitored, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are currently being used to automate and enhance the process. UAVs can capture images that can be analyzed using neural-based methods to extract useful information about the state of the trees in the orchard. However, there are some challenges that must be addressed, such as the scarcity of open-access labeled datasets and the imbalanced distribution of target classes, which include rare events or anomalous vegetation states. To tackle these issues, in this paper, a unique dataset of apple trees observations captured by UAVs has been collected and shared to the research community. This dataset includes healthy and unhealthy trees with formed and unformed crowns. Experiments were conducted using YOLOv5 neural network for object detection to evaluate its effectiveness in solving agricultural remote sensing tasks. To adjust model’s performance, we proposed a task-specific transfer learning approach that involves pre-training the model on a synthetic dataset. The synthetic dataset was generated using object-based augmentation (OBA) with the original target objects.

Coconut price continues to fluctuate; thus, it is not easy to make predictions. Good price modelling is important to accurately predict the future coconut price. Several studies have been conducted to predict the price of coconut using various models. One of the most important and widely used models in time series forecasting is the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). However, price fluctuations is considered a problem with uncertain behaviour. The existing ARIMA time series model is unsuitable for solving this problem, because of the nonlinear series. Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been an effective method in solving nonlinear data pattern problems in the last two decades. The non-linear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) gives good forecast, most especially when series are non-linear. Therefore ARIMA- NARNET is considered a universal approach to forecasting the coconut price. The aim of the study is to establish a linear and nonlinear model in time series to forecast coconut prices. The ability of a hybrid approach that combines ARIMA and NARNET(ANN) models is investigated. Based on the experimental study, the experimental results show that the proposed method ARIMA- NARNET, is better at forecasting the price of coconut, an agriculture commodity, than both the ARIMA model and NARNET models.

North Carolina has the highest density of swine CAFO activity in the U.S. and the entire world. In this work, we aimed to study the impacts on North Carolina communities and develop predictive models to predict the effects of potential future CAFOs.We analyzed how these variables relate to each other and CAFO abundance to apply classical machine learning models. We developed two groups of models. Group A models predict the areas of likely CAFO expansion and Group B models predict the effects on certain wellness metrics in those areas. Group A models can narrow down the areas of concern and allows us to apply group B models. Results of group B models predict changes in the wellness metrics if certain levels of CAFO development were to occur. The developed models prove effective in the objectives outlined. Additionally, the models could prove an effective tool when considering the expansion of CAFOs into currently unaffected areas.;2769-4542;979-8-3503-0095-6;10.1109/ICICT58900.2023.00008;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229540;"Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation;Machine Learning;Prediction;Supervised Learning;Life Expectancy Prediction";"Measurement;Analytical models;Animals;Machine learning;Production;Predictive models;Data models";"animal feed;health hazards;learning (artificial intelligence);rivers";"animal agriculture;CAFO;CAFO data;Cape Fear River;concentrated animal feeding operations;human wellness;machine learning models;North Carolina;U.S. animal farms";;;;12;IEEE;30.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Nowadays, it is directed towards economically, socially, and environmentally acceptable production. Mariculture production begins at the sea, in cages, where fish is being kept until the appropriate market weight and size is achieved. There are different ways how it can affect the marine environment. Fish products, feces, medicine, food, and other factors have an impact on the sea quality parameters. Marine pollution considers the presence of undesirable materials in the ocean environment that affect mariculture, affecting the seawater's physical, chemical, and biological conditions. To help prevent and to monitor marine pollution, sensors connected with artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things, applications, and other software are used. The use of multiparameter probes with different sensors in the sea enables the detection of changes in real-time and instantaneous warning. A mobile application connected to the probe provides information about parameters like salinity, sea temperature, oxygen, depth, pH etc. The goal of the developed mobile application is to prevent more serious marine pollution and impact on the production and environment by monitoring sea conditions, reacting on time in the case of anomalies, recognizing unusual patterns in the parameter value distribution from the existing data, as well as expanding the circle of people who can notice and report possible pollution.

Among the hyperspectral techniques, those based on convex optimization (CO) and deep learning (DE) have gained particular attention. However, DE often relies on a vast amount of training data (big data) and time-consuming manual labeling tasks in order to learn the inherent patterns of hyperspectral images (HSIs). On the other hand, CO typically requires sophisticated mathematical regularization terms for effectively and adaptively addressing the ill-posed HCD inverse problem. Considering these challenges, we employ the convex deep (CODE) small-data learning theory recently invented for hyperspectral satellite remote sensing and propose a semi-supervised graph neural network to achieve very low labeling rates. Furthermore, the proposed CODE-HCD method exploits hyperspectral data affine geometry to design a convex  ${Q}$ -quadratic norm regularizer, whose mathematical form is very simple and, thereby, ensures a computationally efficient algorithm.

Whereas pesticides have been employed to alter agricultural yield, their excessive usage has a detrimental impact on the ecosystem. Determining the need for pesticides depends significantly on the ability to identify illnesses and distinguish them from nutritious deficiencies. The traditional approaches to identifying plant diseases need lengthy, laborious chemical procedures to be completed in a lab. Using machine learning and image processing techniques, this research describes an autonomous method for identifying & categorizing plants diseases. For algorithms training, the features separation technique is used on pictures. To determine which Machines Learning method is most suitable for identifying diseases, the performance of several techniques is assessed using training data. Unseen photographs are contained in the test folder, which is used to verify the system's effectiveness at identifying plant illnesses. Large numbers of photos may be used to train the system, which produces correct results more quickly. Agricultural illnesses are a danger to global agricultural security; however, it is still challenging to rapidly diagnose them since the required infrastructure is lacking in many regions of the world. Since the introduction of exact techniques, impressive accomplishments have been made within the area of categorizing images of leaves.

This issue can exacerbate poverty and food scarcity. Deep Learning has shown promise in computer vision tasks, including disease identification and detection in plants. However, the limited variety of datasets available for different plants and diseases is a major obstacle. One-Shot Learning (OSL), a subfield of meta-learning, can be used to address this challenge when few or limited datasets for specific plants are available. OSL has been employed in other domains such as face and symbol recognition, but its application in plant and disease detection remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we presented several methodologies that can produce an accurate OSL model for plants with limited datasets. OSL employs Siamese Networks and triplet loss functions to create a model that can identify an unknown object or category with just one sample. This approach has the potential to reduce processing time and energy consumption, lower costs associated with massive data storage, and provide farmers with a valuable tool to quickly identify and treat plant diseases. The proposed methodologies aim to significantly improve the accuracy of OSL models for plants with fewer datasets. Furthermore, the use of functions such as the triplet loss function and metric learning is critical for the OSL to perform effectively. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of OSL as a powerful tool for plant disease detection and has important implications for improving crop yields and addressing food scarcity.;;979-8-3503-9926-4;10.1109/ICACITE57410.2023.10182963;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182963;"One-Shot Learning;Deep Learning;Siamese Network;Transfer Learning;Meta Learning;Triplet Loss Function";"Metalearning;Measurement;Plant diseases;Face recognition;Crops;Symbols;Memory";"agriculture;computer vision;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;object detection;plant diseases";"agriculture;computer vision tasks;crop yield;deep learning;farming sector;meta-learning;metric learning;one-shot learning methodology;OSL models;plant disease detection;plant leaf disease identification;Siamese networks;triplet loss function";;;;16;IEEE;24.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The chemical, physical, and biological qualities of soil decide whether it will produce fertile crops.

Crop disease hampers the overall agricultural productivity and for a temperature-controlled crop like apple trees, identification of diseases at beginning stage is of paramount importance. There are two ways to identify and rectify issues relating to apple tree diseases, firstly by engaging expert biologists and secondly via automated identification through image processing. The biggest challenges with identification of diseases via biologist are accuracy, time constraints in case of bigger farms and budgetary limits. This research proposes the use of Machine Learning (ML) technique to aid and assist in automated disease detection and identification, and hence, making it affordable.

To overcome such a situation, in this paper, we used an object detection model known as Yolov5 with a nano variant, which helps detect thousands of small whiteflies rapidly with fewer parameters and power efficiency. Besides conventional pre-processing techniques, tilling images at inference helped to detect tiny whiteflies effectively and classified the abundance level based on counts.

On the other hand, food production is the main cause of water withdrawal. Precision agriculture, based on the Internet of Underground Things (IoUT), has recently been proposed to reduce water withdrawals. IoUT comprises sensors and communication devices that are partially or fully submerged beneath the ground surface. However, the current technology used in IoUT is challenged by inefficient spectral and energy efficiency. This paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based index modulation technique to increase spectral efficiency without raising the system’s bit error rate. The article decreases the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and enhances energy efficiency by employing the X-transform time-domain synchronous index modulation (TDS-IM) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in underground communication. Unlike the radio frequency channel, the underground channel is environment-dependent. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a DL receiver detector to eliminate such environmental dependency and simplify the system’s complexity. This proposal can establish new identification parameters, achieving accurate estimation of the modulated symbols even in harsh communication channels.

It illustrates the effectiveness of using decentralised data among several clients to produce highly effective, reliable models while protecting data privacy. The empirical results show improved model performance for six illness classes (Class_A through Class_F) and four customers (Cl_a, Cl_b, Cl_c, and Cl_d), with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy typically above 95%. For instance, in the regional analysis, Client B attained impressive accuracy and recall of 97.39% and 97.85% for Class_F, suggesting little to no false positives or negatives for this class. In the overall study, the federated learning average results show similarly impressive results, such as Client B, which produced precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy values of 96.45%, 96.31%, and 99%. The little differences between local and global metrics demonstrate federated learning's resilience, which successfully maintains high performance in the face of data decentralisation. Macro, micro, and weighted averages, which provide subtle hints about the model's performance across various classes and data distributions, are also explored in this study.

An example of such cases in agriculture is the headland turning process, which heavily depends on the field geometry, tractor, and implement. Therefore, automating this process can improve time efficiency, optimize land use, and reduce the cognitive burden on semi-autonomous tractor drivers. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for learning complex policies in high-dimensional environments, making it widely used in autonomous driving. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of recent model-free RL algorithms, specifically policy optimization and Q-learning types, for headland turning of a tractor-trailer combination.

In recent years, JSCCM, which efficiently encodes images and videos with low information entropy, has attracted great attention. JSCCM has a structure based on an autoencoder and determines the compression ratios for the image input by adjusting the number of IQ symbol output. The IQ symbol output from the encoder are allocated to symbol constellations with higher degrees of arbitrariness than those in typical square quadrature amplitude modulation and are therefore expected to be strongly affected by the quantization noise. In this paper, we employed quantization to the IQ symbol sequence and investigated its effect. Adjusting the quantizer's clipping ratio and the number of quantization bits, we examined the images' tolerance of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The simulation results showed that by adequately adjusting the clipping ratio, the image quality can be guaranteed to be equivalent to ideal conditions without quantization noise, and the number of required quantization bits that do not degrade the PSNR, was calculated.;2331-9860;978-1-6654-9734-3;10.1109/CCNC51644.2023.10060488;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060488;"deep learning;image coding;Joint source-channel coding;quantization";"Training;Image quality;Quantization (signal);Image coding;PSNR;Image communication;Symbols";"channel coding;combined source-channel coding;convolutional neural nets;data compression;deep learning (artificial intelligence);entropy;error statistics;image coding;modulation coding;quadrature amplitude modulation;quantisation (signal);telecommunication computing";"analog-to-digital;clipping ratio;CNN-based joint source-channel coding;communication devices;compression ratios;deep learning-based joint source-channel coding modulation;digital-to-analog converters;image input;image quality;image transmission;images;IQ symbol output;IQ symbol sequence;JSCCM;low information entropy;peak signal-to-noise ratio;quantization noise;quantizer;required quantization bits;symbol constellations;typical square quadrature amplitude modulation";;;;11;IEEE;17.3.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

User requests for these services (also known as workload) are placed over Virtual Machines (VMs) for execution. These VMs are hosted over Physical Machines (PMs) to abstract processing capabilities of these PMs. Over a period, Cloud services experience fluctuations in the workload pattern. To match the resources required for serving the varying workload, VMs must be added or removed autonomically as performing the same task manually is inefficient. Moreover, VMs take some fraction of time to be setup before they can be used. The goal behind automatic scale-up and scale-down operations is to ensure that the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the cloud service provider and cloud client is upheld and cloud users experience acceptable levels of Quality of Service (QoS). The essential task in achieving this aim of automated scaling is to forecast future workload, using the data on past workload history, so that enough VMs may be setup in advance to match the anticipated change in workload trend. Auto-scalers which provision resources by predicting the workload are categorized as proactive auto-scalers.

For this reason, a new dataset of coffee bean defect images is built in this research. 3 classes were defined and obtained from the image sample of coffee beans, namely good coffee beans, defective coffee beans, and non-valid coffee beans. Moreover, specifically for the class of defective coffee beans, the new dataset also provides ground truth image samples for 17 classes of coffee bean with defects which was defined by SNI 01-2907-2008. Two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture models, InceptionResnetV2 and MobileNet, were tested to do an initial benchmarking process to classify coffee beans and their types of defects. Both architectures show very promising results to classify coffee bean images in 3-classes. With 92.52% of accuracy, MobileNet outperforms slightly InceptionResnetV2. Both architectures are fairly easy to classify the 3-classes of coffee bean images. But the experimental results indicate that the task of classifying more specifically the 17 classes of different types of defects in coffee beans is still quite difficult. Although the accuracy of InceptionResnetV2 of 53.35% seems much higher than the accuracy of MobileNet, the two architectures still seem to be struggling to identify each type of coffee bean defect. This benchmarking results will serve as the initial basis that helps to analyze the level of complexity of problems in the coffee bean new dataset, as well as the basis for further investigations and research processes to improve the performance of the future coffee bean classifier machine.;;979-8-3503-2494-5;10.1109/ICITRI59340.2023.10249345;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10249345;"benchmark;dataset;coffee bean;defect;image";"Technological innovation;Digital images;Benchmark testing;Complexity theory;Convolutional neural networks;Object recognition;Task analysis";"agricultural products;convolutional neural nets;flaw detection;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);product quality";"CNN architecture model;coffee bean classifier machine;coffee bean defect classification;coffee bean defect image;coffee bean quality;convolutional neural network;digital image processing;InceptionResnetV2;machine learning;MobileNet;nonvalid coffee beans;SNI 01-2907-2008";;;;8;IEEE;19.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

World Health Organization estimates that around 10 million people die from cancer in 2020. Cancers of the colon, breast, lung, central nervous system, cervix, and prostate are quite common. In most cases, cancer may be efficiently treated if caught early. The biological data included in microarrays is very informative. This data analysis aids in the identification and treatment of difficult illnesses. It is quite difficult and time consuming to train a model with such a large number of features, when they are all input directly. Therefore, we employ an Evolutionary Algorithm named as Group Counseling Optimizer (GCO) in tandem with Extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) to classify cancer in microarray data. At the outset, we have the Extreme Gradient Boosting ensemble-selected features. In this step, irrelevant features are eliminated, and a set of optimal characteristics for detecting cancer has been generated. In a second usage, the evolutionary method is used for cancer classification.;;979-8-3503-4770-8;10.1109/IMCERT57083.2023.10075236;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10075236;"XGBoost;Feature selection;GCO;Classification;evolutionary algorithm";"Employee welfare;Data analysis;Lung;Evolutionary computation;Organizations;Boosting;Market research";"biological organs;cancer;data analysis;diseases;evolutionary computation;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical computing;neurophysiology;pattern classification";"cancer classification;Evolutionary Algorithm;Extreme gradient boost;Extreme Gradient Boosting";;;;32;IEEE;24.3.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Traditional credit risk models often suffer from inadequate predictive accuracy due to overlooked feature combinations and weak supervisory signals. Addressing these limitations, we present a novel approach for credit default prediction that integrates feature interactions and contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce second-order interactions atop standard linear models to achieve low-order feature interplay. Concurrently, the integration of deep neural networks and attention mechanisms facilitates the learning of concealed high-order features, thus enhancing the model’s non-linear modeling capabilities and illuminating latent feature associations. Further, to ameliorate the issues of noise and diminished supervisory signals, we embed slight noise in feature embeddings for data augmentation and construct contrastive views, ultimately refining feature quality. To attest to the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, benchmarking against eight predictive methods including LR, XGBoost, and FiBiNET.

However, most studies fail to fully explore temporal dependencies among MI-related patterns generated in different stages during MI tasks, resulting in limited MI-EEG decoding performance. Apart from feature extraction, learning temporal dependencies is equally important to develop a subject-specific MI-based BCI because every subject has their own way of performing MI tasks. In this paper, a novel temporal dependency learning convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention mechanism is proposed to address MI-EEG decoding. The network first learns spatial and spectral information from multi-view EEG data via the spatial convolution block. Then, a series of non-overlapped time windows is employed to segment the output data, and the discriminative feature is further extracted from each time window to capture MI-related patterns generated in different stages. Furthermore, to explore temporal dependencies among discriminative features in different time windows, we design a temporal attention module that assigns different weights to features in various time windows and fuses them into more discriminative features. The experimental results on the BCI Competition IV-2a (BCIC-IV-2a) and OpenBMI datasets show that our proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves the average accuracy of 79.48%, improved by 2.30% on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset.

PEAMATL: A Strategy for Developing Near-Infrared Spectral Prediction Models Under Domain Shift Using Self-Supervised Transfer Learning;"Y. Yang; S. Sun; M. Huang; Q.

However, calibration has to be conducted for a prediction model being constructed on data from the source domain if we want to apply the model to a new target domain. Most deep transfer learning (DTL) methods, which extract domain-invariant features from the source domain samples and transfer these features to enhance the representation ability for target domain data, are available to calibrate prediction models. However, due to the difficulty of measuring samples’ reference values (label), the reliance on labeled samples for supervised techniques to extract domain-invariant features remains a major bottleneck. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised TL (SSTL) approach named pyramid external attention model and masked autoencoder (MAE)-based TL (PEAMATL) for learning and transferring generalized domain-invariant features from samples’ spectra, aiming to accurately predict unseen samples’ reference values. PEAMATL first trains a pyramid encoder consisting of three external attention modules (EAMs) to extract multiscale features from unlabeled source domain samples using a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework; second, it transfers the pretrained spectra encoder followed by an initialized prediction head network to build a prediction model; finally, PEAMATL refines the model parameters using a portion of the labeled target domain samples to adapt to unseen target domain samples. The calibration analysis is tested on tablet, melamine, and apple datasets for predicting active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), turbidity point, soluble solid content (SSC), and firmness. Compared with three existing supervised and two self-supervised TL methods, the proposed PEAMATL method achieves at least 3.32%–30.88% prediction error reduction on 19 out of 20 scenarios involving three types of domain shift. Therefore, PEAMATL has the potential to be a generic framework for tackling the common problem of domain shift-induced performance degradation of prediction models in the domain of NIR-based quantitative analysis.";1557-9662;;10.1109/TIM.2023.3273689;"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFD2100601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62273166); 111 Project(grant numbers:B23008); Fonds de Recherche du Québec Nature et technologies (FRQNT) Programme de recherche en partenariat—Agriculture Durable(grant numbers:G259806 FRQ-NT 322853 X-Coded 259432); China Scholarship Council (CSC); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10121191;"Domain adaptation;masked autoencoders (MAEs);near-infrared (NIR) technology;prediction model;self-supervised learning (SSL);transfer learning (TL)";"Data models;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Transfer learning;Standards;Data mining;Analytical models";"deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);supervised learning;unsupervised learning";"3.32%-30.88% prediction error reduction;cost-effective analytical techniques;deep transfer learning methods;domain shift-induced performance degradation;existing supervised self-supervised TL methods;initialized prediction head network;labeled samples;labeled target domain samples;learning transferring generalized domain-invariant features;model parameters;near-infrared spectral prediction models;novel self-supervised TL approach;PEAMATL;prediction model;pyramid external attention model;self-supervised learning framework;self-supervised transfer learning;spectra prediction models;supervised techniques;target domain data;two self-supervised TL methods;unlabeled source domain samples;unseen samples;unseen target domain samples";;;;48;IEEE;8.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Contrary to existing methods that build on auxiliary tasks such as image generation or equivariance, we propose a self-training approach where, departing from generic keypoints, a landmark detector and descriptor is trained to improve itself, tuning the keypoints into distinctive landmarks. To this end, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between producing new pseudo-labels through feature clustering and learning distinctive features for each pseudo-class through contrastive learning. With a shared backbone for the landmark detector and descriptor, the keypoint locations progressively converge to stable landmarks, filtering those less stable. Compared to previous works, our approach can learn points that are more flexible in terms of capturing large viewpoint changes. We validate our method on a variety of difficult datasets, including LS3D, BBCPose, Human3.6M and PennAction, achieving new state of the art results.

Constant agricultural maintenance becomes quite difficult. To solve this issue, a smart electric fence is created that energizes when an animal approaches it, and de-energizes when it moves away. The proposed system produces a very tiny shock pulses that paralyze the animal instead of injuring it. Additionally, an autonomous irrigation system is installed that activates the pump whenever the soil becomes dry and shuts it down when the soil becomes wet. Solar energy, a free energy source, powers the entire system. The demo module has two sets of IR sensors which are placed in separate locations all across the module. IR sensors are used to detect an approaching animal at the boundary. These miniature pole-mounted sensors also include conducting wires that produce shocking pulses. A high-frequency switching transformer with a ferrite core can produce shocking pulses when an IC 555 is configured in an astable mode of operation. The main processing unit is built on an Arduino nano-board. Information about the soil state, such as whether it is dry or wet, the motor state, such as whether it is on or off can be displayed on an LCD and transmitted to the app through the Wi-Fi module. An ESP8266-based communication link with a smartphone is employed. Simple soil sensors are used, and the water pumping motor connected to a tiny plastic water container will be mechanically controlled based on the data collected by these sensors. The motor will start running if the earth is completely dried out. Likewise, if the ground is damp, the motor will be off. When the fence is activated, the buzzer is activated automatically to notify inmates of their whereabouts. Once the fence is energized, it remains energized until the reset button is activated.;;978-1-6654-5630-2;10.1109/ICAAIC56838.2023.10140295;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10140295;"smart electric fence;Automatic irrigation;esp8266 (Expressive System);Arduino nano;liquid crystal Display";"Integrated circuits;Irrigation;Animals;Wires;Soil;Transformer cores;Electric fences";"agriculture;control engineering computing;electric fences;Internet of Things;irrigation;microcontrollers;sensors;smart phones;soil;temperature sensors;water pumps;wireless LAN";"approaching animal;Arduino nanoboard;automatic irrigation system;autonomous irrigation system;constant agricultural maintenance;demo module;energizes;ESP8266-based communication link;free energy source;high-frequency switching transformer;huge losses;IR sensors;main processing unit;miniature pole-mounted sensors;motor state;produce shocking pulses;separate locations;simple soil sensors;smart electric fence built;soil state;solar energy;tiny plastic water container;tiny shock pulses;water pumping motor;Wi-Fi module";;;;15;IEEE;8.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

There is always a risk factor because they are harmful to people if unintentionally consumed. Thus, a Bluetooth-based rat catcher is developed, which traps the rats/mice, with the help of ultrasonic waves. Once the rat is trapped it gives a notification to the user's phone, that the rat is trapped. The user can open or close the trap in the mobile app, to release the rat.

It is a staple food for more than one-third of the world’s population. The production of wheat depends on various factors, such as climate, temperature, soil, pests, bacteria, and other biotic and abiotic factors. However, diseases can have a significant impact on wheat production. Various wheat diseases can affect crop yields,including leaf rust, leaf spot, spike infection, virus, bacterial back chaff, bacterial spike blight, and aphids. Leaf rust, in particular, is known to cause severe damage to wheat leaves. To combat these diseases, researchers have been investigating the use of advanced technologies such as deep learning and image-processing approaches for plant disease recognition. The process of disease detection involves several steps, including image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The accuracy of these steps directly affects the reliability and accuracy of the classification algorithms used to identify plant diseases. Recent studies have reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques used in this context and evaluated their effectiveness in real life applications. Overall, the use of advanced technologies such as deep learning and image processing for disease detection in wheat crops holds great promise in improving crop yields and reducing losses due to diseases. By identifying diseases at an early stage, farmers can take appropriate measures to control the spread of the disease and prevent significant crop damage. This research work presents a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art work that has been carried out in this context and the effectiveness of the techniques in real-time.;2768-5330;979-8-3503-9725-3;10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142846;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142846;"Computer Vision;Deep Learning;Segmentation;Convolutional Neural Network;Recurrent Neural Network;K-Nearest Neighbors;Artificial Neural Networks;GoogLeNet;Visual Geometry Group.";"Deep learning;Plant diseases;Temperature dependence;Technological innovation;Temperature;Crops;Production";"agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;image classification;microorganisms;plant diseases";"abiotic factors;bacterial spike blight;biotic factors;consumed cereal;crop yields,including;deep learning;disease detection;image-processing approaches;important cereal crop;leaf rust;leaf spot;plant disease recognition;plant diseases;reducing losses;significant crop damage;wheat crops;wheat diseases;wheat leaf disease;wheat leaves;wheat production";;;;32;IEEE;8.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
The Role of the Eyes: Investigating Face Cognition Mechanisms Using Machine Learning and Partial Face Stimuli;"I. Chanpornpakdi; T. Tanaka";"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan";IEEE Access;18.8.2023;2023;11;;86122;86131;Face cognition mechanism has changed throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic because of wearing masks. Previous studies found that holistic face processing enhances face cognition ability, and covering part of the face features lowers such an ability. However, the question of why people can recognize faces regardless of missing some clues about the face feature remains unsolved. To study the face cognition mechanism, event-related potential (ERP) evoked during the rapid serial visual presentation task is used. ERP is often hidden under large artifacts and needs to be averaged across the tremendous number of trials, but increasing the trial number can cause fatigue and affect evoked ERP. To overcome this limitation, we adopt machine learning and aim to investigate the partial face cognition mechanism without directly considering the pattern characteristic of the ERP. We implemented an xDAWN spatial filter covariance matrix method to enhance the data quality and a support vector machine classification model to predict the participant’s event of interest using ERP components evoked in the full and partial face cognition tasks. The combination of the missing two face components and the physical response was also investigated to explore the role of each face component and find the possibility of reducing fatigue caused during the experiment. Our results show that the classification accuracy decreased when the eye component was missing and became lowest  $(p < 0.005)$  when the eyes and mouth were absent, with an accuracy of 0.748 ± 0.092 in the button press task and 0.746 ± 0.084 in the no button press task (n.s.). We also observed that the button press error rate increased when the eyes were absent and reached its maximum when the eyes and mouth were covered  $(p < 0.05)$ . These results suggest that the eyes might be the most effective component, the mouth might also play a secondary role in face cognition, and no button press task could be used in substitution of a button press task to reduce the workload.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3295118;"Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Moonshot Research and Development(grant numbers:JPMJMS2237); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182239;"Partial face cognition;event-related potential;P300;machine learning;Xdawn";"Face recognition;Task analysis;Cognition;Event detection;Presses;Visualization;Machine learning";"bioelectric potentials;brain-computer interfaces;cognition;diseases;electroencephalography;epidemics;face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pattern classification;signal classification;spatial filters;support vector machines";"ERP;face component;face feature;face features lowers such an ability;full face cognition tasks;holistic face processing enhances face cognition;machine learning;missing two face components;no button press task;partial face cognition mechanism;partial face cognition tasks;partial face stimuli";;1;;50;CCBYNCND;13.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

In this paper, we present a data resource that uses the FoodData Central (FDC) nutrient database to explore the combination of food images, nutritional information, and text with ML. We begin by providing an overview of machine learning and its applications in nutrition research, including the use of ML algorithms to identify food intake patterns, predict nutrient intakes, and evaluate dietary guidelines. We then describe the features and applications of Inception-v3, Inception-v4, and MobileNetV2 in ML, highlighting how these models can be used to extract nutritional information from food images. To further explore the potential of ML in nutrition research, we developed a quick search app that integrates images, text, and nutritional information. This app uses image recognition algorithms to identify food items in pictures, and text processing techniques to extract food information from text data. Users can simply take a picture of a food item and the app will provide the details of its nutritional content. This app can be used to facilitate the study of food and nutrition information and help promote healthier eating habits. In conclusion, the development of data resources and apps that use ML algorithms can be particularly helpful in processing large amounts of nutrition data and making it more accessible to the public.

In this study, a multi-level system that includes feature extraction, feature selection, and classification were designed. This research analyses the performance of a range of k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and neural network (NN) classifiers. From a dataset including 13,611 samples, a set of 16 features is extracted. In addition, the minimal redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) and ReliefF feature ranking algorithms are employed to choose the optimal set of features for training the ML models.

Users can ask queries to chatbots just like they would to a human. But chatbots are increasingly often utilized in online conversation services. Artificial intelligence is used by these bots to comprehend human input and react appropriately. The three most important areas to focus on are medicine/health, agriculture, and education. Nowadays, chatbots can be utilized anyplace a person can talk to a computer at any time. The fastest expanding sectors for hiring are customer service, sales, marketing, and branding, as well as human resources. This prediction tasks are now carried out by other chatbots (especially in the medical industry), made possible by developments in AI and data mining methods. The number of patients is rising quickly every day as lifestyles change, just like in the modern world. As a result, both the hospital and the local health care systems are expanding quickly. Patients with hectic schedules must wait a long time for doctors. Some diseases take longer to recover from. Around the world, heart disease and ENT diseases are prevalent issues. 4,444 people, both young and elderly, pass away from heart attacks every day. The main challenges of cardio patients are they do not know how to prevent and cure the diseases and the solutions are not available for their doubts. In order to improve both business and healthcare outcomes, healthcare practitioners will be able to collect data remotely, diagnose patients accurately from a distance, and use AI to evaluate data.

Current monitoring practices are predominantly individualized, making them inefficient and challenging for farmers to manage on a large scale. Hence, there’s an urgent need for an effective solution to identify and classify these diseases swiftly and accurately. Addressing this need, we introduce the multi-input cross-layer UNet model (MICL-UNet). Enhanced with numerous residual connections, our model ensures minimal information loss from the input. Given the role of nonlinear activation functions at every layer, we strategically incorporated input data at multiple stages in the model, reinforcing it with terminal-layer residual connections. This design aims to distribute critical image features evenly across all layers. The MICL-UNet displayed superior performance over baseline models, achieving accuracy scores of 99.63% for Vegetable datasets, 99.25% for PLD datasets, and 98.7% for Guava Disease datasets. Beyond its academic implications, the MICL-UNet offers significant practical benefits.

A sample of 120 durian fruits with variation in maturity was used to calibrate the model using different machine-learning algorithms, consisting of partial least squares regression (PLSR), least square support vector machine (LS-SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches. Initially, the rind model provided better predictive performance than the stem model for all algorithms. However, combining either the stem or the rind spectra (or even the fruit density) as the independent variables, the built models produced better results in prediction than from using either the stem or rind spectra alone. Among the models investigated, the combined spectra model of the stem and rind without spike spectra and using the ANN algorithm produced the best prediction with a correlation coefficient of 0.848, a root mean square error of prediction of 2.215%, and a residual predictive deviation of 1.833.

However, accurately determining harvest-readiness can be challenging due to the cauliflower head being covered by its canopy. While deep learning enables automated harvest-readiness estimation, errors can occur due to field-variability and limited training data. In this letter, we analyze the reliability of a harvest-readiness classifier with interpretable machine learning. By identifying clusters of saliency maps, we derive reliability scores for each classification result using knowledge about the domain and the image properties. For unseen data, the reliability can be used to 1) inform farmers to improve their decision-making and 2) increase the model prediction accuracy.

Existing methods either ignore the rich topological information or sacrifice plasticity for stability. To this end, we present Hierarchical Prototype Networks (HPNs) which extract different levels of abstract knowledge in the form of prototypes to represent the continuously expanded graphs. Specifically, we first leverage a set of Atomic Feature Extractors (AFEs) to encode both the elemental attribute information and the topological structure of the target node. Next, we develop HPNs to adaptively select relevant AFEs and represent each node with three levels of prototypes. In this way, whenever a new category of nodes is given, only the relevant AFEs and prototypes at each level will be activated and refined, while others remain uninterrupted to maintain the performance over existing nodes. Theoretically, we first demonstrate that the memory consumption of HPNs is bounded regardless of how many tasks are encountered. Then, we prove that under mild constraints, learning new tasks will not alter the prototypes matched to previous data, thereby eliminating the forgetting problem. The theoretical results are supported by experiments on five datasets, showing that HPNs not only outperform state-of-the-art baseline techniques but also consume relatively less memory.

Though the presence of weeds in agricultural pitches can seriously reduce crop output and agricultural production. Customary weed management techniques include a huge amount of manual labor which takes a long time, and frequent use of chemical herbicides that may be harmful to both the environment and human health. This work suggests a unique method for weed detection in smart agricultural farms by combining Internet of Things (IoT) and Deep Learning (DL) methods with image processing. The suggested method takes benefit of recent developments in computer vision, IoT, and DL to quickly and accurately identify and categorize weeds. To take pictures and gather environmental data, IoT devices like high-resolution cameras and sensors are being positioned in agricultural areas. The pipeline for processing images consists of various steps, counting feature extraction, cataloguing, feature extraction from input images, and picture acquisition. The captured images are initially pre-processed to improve their quality and eliminate noise. The pre-processed photos are further subjected to refined image-processing algorithms to extract pertinent features from them. To classify weeds, the collected characteristics are then used as inputs to a deep learning prototypical, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). The suggested approach has several advantages, such as precise and prompt weed detection, less dependency on chemical herbicides, and increased agricultural productivity. Farmers can remotely monitor their crops using IoT technology and get alerts when weeds are found. This lowers expenses and diminishes a contrary effect on the atmosphere while providing actual and targeted weed treatment.;2768-0673;979-8-3503-4148-5;10.1109/I-SMAC58438.2023.10290187;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10290187;"agriculture;artificial intelligence;deep learning;convolutional neural network;sensors;IoT;weed detection;agricultural productivity";"Productivity;Deep learning;Image recognition;Crops;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Convolutional neural networks";;;;;;20;IEEE;26.10.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The costs and effects of BRD can severely damage a farm’s economy, since raising dairy calves is one of the largest economic investments, and diagnosing BRD requires intensive and specialized labor that is hard to find. Precision technologies based on the Internet of Things (IoT), such as automatic feeders, scales, and accelerometers, can help detect behavioral changes before outward clinical signs of BRD. Such early detection enables early treatment, and thus faster recovery, with less long term effects. In this paper, we propose a framework for BRD diagnosis, its early detection, and identification of BRD persistency status using precision IoT technologies. We adopt a machine learning model paired with a cost-sensitive feature selection problem called Cost Optimization Worth (COW). COW maximizes prediction accuracy given a budget constraint. We show that COW is NP-Hard, and propose an efficient heuristic with polynomial complexity called Cost-Aware Learning Feature (CALF).

However, in many real-life situations, ground truth is not available, and the performance of unsupervised NNs is still susceptible to enhancement. To overcome this challenge, this letter presents a new loss function to improve the performance of unsupervised HSI segmentation models. The spectral loss function,  $Sl$ , which can be included in different models, is based on the purity of the unmixing endmembers and the spectral similarity of the clusters provided by the NN to determine the classes. It is incorporated into a 3-D convolutional autoencoder (AE) to validate its performance on four standard HSI benchmarks. Furthermore, its performance has been qualitatively examined in a real case study, an oil spill without ground truth. The results show that  $Sl$  is a breakthrough in unsupervised HS segmentation, obtaining the best overall performance and highlighting the importance of spectral signatures. Additionally, the dimensional reduction is also vital in compacting the spectral information, which facilitates its segmentation.

Plants can exhibit very large scale changes, which presents great challenge for accurate crop/weed segmentation. Recent works have shown that multi-scale features are useful to segment objects with different scales. In this work, we propose a Dense Multi-scale Convolutional Network (DMSCN) for pixel-wise crop/weed segmentation. Our network has an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder comprises of a Dense Convolutional Network (DCN) and a Dense Multi-Scale Atrous Pooling (DMSAP) module. DCN is composed of standard and atrous convolutions with dense connections. The architecture of DCN allows the encoder to increase the density of feature maps while avoiding signal decimation due to the dimension reduction. The proposed DMSAP connects a set of standard and atrous convolutional layers with different dilation rates in a densely cascaded manner. DMSAP is able to capture features with dense scale sampling and large receptive field. A simple yet effective decoder is used to refine the segmentation results by combining high and low-level features of the encoder. Extensive experiments are performed on four crop/weed datasets.

Flood prediction offers a huge challenge for researchers struggling to predict floods since long time. In this article, flood forecasting model using federated learning technique has been proposed. Federated Learning is the most advanced technique of machine learning (ML) that guarantees data privacy, ensures data availability, promises data security, and handles network latency trials inherent in prediction of floods by prohibiting data to be transferred over the network for model training. Federated Learning technique urges for onsite training of local data models, and focuses on transmission of these local models on the network instead of sending huge data set towards central server for local model aggregation and training of global data model at the central server. In this article, the proposed model integrates locally trained models of eighteen clients, investigates at which station flooding is about to happen and generates flood alert towards a specific client with five days lead time. A local feed forward neural network (FFNN) model is trained at the client station where the flood has been expected. Flood forecasting module of local FFNN model predicts the expected water level by taking multiple regional parameters as input. The dataset of five different rivers and barrages has been collected from 2015 to 2021 considering four aspects including snow melting, rainfall-runoff, flow routing and hydrodynamics.

The high-resolution spatial information of PG is of great significance to precise agricultural management and quantitative environmental assessment. Many studies have examined the role that remote sensing (RS) technology could play in mapping and monitoring PG coverage. However, these methods, which employ either the traditional machine learning algorithms or the deep learning models, depend on massive manually labeled samples. To address this problem, this article proposes a new cross-scale sample transferring method to generate high-resolution samples for automated PG mapping. The proposed method aims to transfer reliable label information from Sentinel-2 images (10 m) to high-resolution images (0.2 m) in a pixel–scene–pixel–object (PSPO) transferring process. In the proposed PG mapping workflow, the low-resolution label information of PG/non-PG can be obtained from an advanced plastic greenhouse index (APGI) which is calculated in Sentinel-2 images, and then, the label information is transferred to the corresponding high-resolution images using the proposed PSPO transferring method. Finally, the transferred high-resolution samples are used to train the deep semantic segmentation model and produce PG mapping results.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) in comparison to other multiple-boosting algorithms for SM prediction. Appropriate feature selection is vital for achieving accurate predictions, and this study focuses on identifying relevant features and assessing CatBoost's suitability for the task. The study incorporates several boosting algorithms including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and CatBoost to estimate SM. Results indicate that radar backscatter coefficient, soil roughness, and digital elevation model (DEM) are crucial features for SM retrieval. Comparatively, CatBoost outperforms GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM in various feature combinations. The most favorable results are obtained when utilizing all features as inputs for the algorithm. These optimal results yield a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.40 vol.%, mean relative error (MRE) of 0.16 vol.%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.26 vol.%, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73.

Because weather conditions can change quickly, farmers have often checked that the water levels of their crops were ideal for good growing conditions. Farmers would benefit from developing a simple device to determine the water level of crops at any time. This research designs a noncontact water level detection system, including a data acquisition system, a data management monitoring system, and an instant messenger. In the data acquisition system, a digital water gauge is designed, mainly using image recognition technology to identify the water level in a barrel. Our research shows that using a black dot with a diameter of 1 cm as the water gauge scale can achieve 100% recognition results at a distance of 110 cm. Considering that applying a contactless water level detection system (CWLDS) in agriculture is a fixed measurement method and an external light source is supported, 100% identification can be obtained, and the operation cost of a CWLDS can be reduced without an additional machine learning technique. To effectively reduce the transmission cost, the reading part of the digital water gauge is divided into single-barrel and multi-barrel parts. The water level information is sent to a management center through a narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) transmission module. This system provides a well-structured and systematic approach to the problem of measuring water levels in pickling barrels. Through the data management monitoring system, the collected water level of each object is matched with a database in the host to determine whether the water level is abnormal.

Machine learning algorithms are useful for drought prediction because they are simpler, faster, and require fewer data points than dynamic models. Vegetation can become visibly dry, and water levels in reservoirs and lakes can drop, as a direct result of a drought. In the long run, it may be more expensive to manage effects like subsidence, seawater intrusion, as well as ecosystem damage. The social and economic harm caused by drought can be greatly mitigated if we have the ability to monitor water shortages in near real time as well as provide precise drought forecasting from weeks to seasons. There are a number of ways in which drought indices can be tracked and predicted. Historically, PDSI and SPI have been used to foretell drought zones.

Using a random forest (RF) model with lag durations of 1–12 months, drought was predicted. The accuracy of SPI and SPEI’s predictions will rise when the time frame is extended.

Therefore, predicting thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy is one of the crucial requirements for the planning and management of many applications, including agriculture, flood control, and air traffic control. This study extensively applied the historical lightning and meteorological data from 2011 to 2018 of the southern regions of Peninsular Malaysia to predict thunderstorm occurrence. Positive CG lightning rarely occurs compared to negative CG lightning and also due to the non-linear and complex characteristics of the thunderstorm and lightning itself, leading to an imbalance in the dataset. The resampling technique called SMOTE is introduced to overcome the imbalance of the training dataset. Then the dataset is trained and tested with five Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Decision Trees (DT), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), and Gradient Boosting (GB). The results have shown a good prediction with accuracy (74% to 95%), recall (72% to 93%), precision (76% to 97%), and F1-Score (74% to 95%) with SMOTE.

These decisions have significant implications including, most importantly, the economic well-being of the farmers. In this paper, our objective is to accurately predict crop prices using historical price information, climate conditions, soil type, location, and other key determinants of crop prices. This is a technically challenging problem, which has been attempted before. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning based approach to achieve increased accuracy in price prediction. The proposed approach uses graph neural networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) model to exploit geospatial dependencies in prices. Our approach works well with noisy legacy data and produces a performance that is at least 20 % better than the results available in the literature. We are able to predict prices up to 30 days ahead. We choose two vegetables, potato (stable price behavior) and tomato (volatile price behavior) and work with noisy public data available from Indian agricultural markets.;2161-8089;979-8-3503-2069-5;10.1109/CASE56687.2023.10260494;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260494;;"Deep learning;Crops;Soil;Graph neural networks;Behavioral sciences;Noise measurement;Convolutional neural networks";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;decision making;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph neural networks;pricing";"agricultural crop price prediction;climate condition;CNN;convolutional neural network model;decision-making;deep learning based approach;farmers;GNN;graph neural networks;historical price information;Indian agricultural markets;noisy legacy data;noisy public data;stable price behavior;volatile price behavior";;;;13;IEEE;28.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

KishanRakshak is a transfer learning approach based Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model which when applied and fine-tuned on a custom made dataset classified the percentage of damage that has occurred in the field. These classifications are adhering to the government rules. Instead of making use of drones to capture the images of damaged crops which is rather a costly process, images are obtained through smartphones' cameras at certain angles making it much cost effective.

Beetroot crops are essential to the world's food systems, but several illnesses often affect their quality and productivity. To suggest a CNN model using federated learning to analyse data from several clients while preserving privacy for a quick and precise diagnosis. The method analyses the severity of the five stages of beetroot leaf diseases using a federated learning technique across several local clients to use precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as performance measurements. The review showed that performance had improved consistently for all customers. As an example, Client X had a prediction accuracy of 0.97, which increased gradually to 0.98 for both Client P and Client R. Additionally, as shown by the macro-average (94.15-94.17%), weighted average (94.67%), and micro-average (94.62%) scores for top-performing customers, the model's performance remained stable and resilient throughout all severity levels. The study's findings support using a CNN model built on federated learning for scalable, effective, and privacy-preserving disease control in agriculture. The promising results suggest the potential for extending such approaches to other agricultural products, considerably advancing efforts to ensure global food security. The research also showed that the CNN model could learn and develop continuously in a federated learning scenario, highlighting its usefulness as a dynamic tool that adapts to new illness patterns.

On top of that, the ensemble learning model, which takes the best parts of different ML models and puts them together, deserves more attention. In this study, a stacking-based ensemble learning model is used to predict rain based on Indian climate parameters. Rainfall is vital for agriculture. Rainfall has been hard to predict in recent years because the weather is always changing. Predicting rain makes people more aware and helps them plan ahead so they can protect their crops from rain. There are now a lot of ways to predict rain. The goal of this paper is to give clients from different fields information about climate so they can understand how important changes in climate and the environment are. Precipitation, temperature, and other aspects of the atmosphere, such as humidity, etc. Estimating how much rain will fall is a very important question in the science of meteorology. Linear Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and Support vector regression (SVR), are used as base models. As a second-layer learner, the weighting algorithm combines the results from the base models to make predictions. For testing, daily observations were thought about. We used India’s rainfall data to test the accuracy of regressors such as SVM, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Our goal is to get the best possible result and a more accurate prediction of rainfall. To do this, we stacked and ensembled the above-mentioned regressors, and the accuracy of these hybrid models increased exponentially, with a maximum accuracy of 81.2%. This means that using hybrid models helps predict rainfall more accurately. Overall, performance evaluation measures show that the proposed stacking ensemble multi-ML model can provide a flexible and reasonable framework for making predictions that can be used in other regions.;2832-143X;979-8-3503-4696-1;10.1109/ISCON57294.2023.10112077;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10112077;"Rainfall Prediction;Machine Learning;Regression;Ensemble Stacking";"Support vector machines;Rain;Computational modeling;Stacking;Linear regression;Predictive models;Boosting";"agriculture;geophysics computing;learning (artificial intelligence);logistic regression;rain;random forests;regression analysis;support vector machines";"base models;different fields information;different ML models;hybrid models;India's rainfall data;Indian climate parameters;Linear Regression;Logistic Regression;machine learning techniques;multiML model;predicting rain;rainfall prediction;Random Forest;stacking ensemble learning model;stacking-based ensemble learning model;Support vector regression";;;;17;IEEE;4.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

If that happens and a perfect cycle repeats every year, it will also increase the number of nutrients in the soil. This proj ect includes the analysis of the property of the soil by measuring certain environmental parameters such as nitrogen, potassium, and the phosphorous content in the soil and also environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, ph. level and the rainfall amount. This data acquired further undergoes some pre-processing techniques like cleaning the data and transformation of the data to the desired format. The cleaned data is then split into two divisions. One is for training and the other one is for testing the software. The data used for training is then used analyzed using various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Tree algorithm, and the Random Forest algorithm. Then a graph is generated for each of the algorithm based on certain parameters. These parameters include precision comparison, recall comparison, and the Fl score comparison for various fruits like apple, banana, grapes, mango, muskmelon, orange, papaya, etc., and other crops varieties such as chickpea, coffee, kidney beans, lentils, moth beans, maize, etc. Once all the parameters are analyzed using the graph, the best crop that is suitable for the soil will be suggested to the farmer. Using this data, he/she can sow a suitable crop and increase the average yield of the soil.;;979-8-3503-9846-5;10.1109/ICICACS57338.2023.10099661;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099661;"Environmental parameters;Crop prediction;Constructor model;Accuracy;Precision;Recall;Fl score";"Training;Machine learning algorithms;Software algorithms;Crops;Soil;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms";"agricultural products;agriculture;crops;decision trees;food products;kidney;learning (artificial intelligence);random forests;soil;supervised learning";"aids;cleaned data;crop prediction;crops varieties;Decision Tree algorithm;economic growth;environmental condition;environmental parameters;farmer;Fl score comparison;food products;human society;Linear Discriminant Analysis;machine learning algorithms;maximum yield;papaya;perfect crop;perfect cycle repeats every year;phosphorous content;proj ect;Random Forest algorithm;suitable crop;supervised learning model;technologists;urbanization";;;;9;IEEE;19.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

This is because it is difficult for drone pilots to recognize power lines at long distances, even on sunny days, and power lines are less visible in rainy or foggy weather. Therefore, power line detection is necessary for safe drone flight. This article proposes an algorithm that can recognize various shapes and locations of multiple power lines while improving the recognition performance of power lines compared to previous studies. YOLO, a deep learning technology used for object detection, is used to recognize power lines as multiple bounding boxes, and center points of these bounding boxes are sorted and integrated. This algorithm improves the power line detection performance by excluding incorrectly detected power lines and restoring undetected parts of the power lines. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the intersection-over-union (IoU) and F1-score, which were 0.674 and 0.528, respectively. This performance was superior to those of U-Net, LaneNet and BiSeNet V2 which are deep learning technologies for segmentation. The proposed method was mounted on the embedded system of the test drone, and tests were conducted indoor and outdoor. Then, the average frames per second (FPS) value was calculated as 10.05.

Background noise degrades image quality, despite extensive research aimed at finding a solution to this problem and the anticipation of a plethora of possible countermeasures. Methods for picture filtering, including those based on machine learning and those based on optimization, are detailed here. It has been possible to categorize these methods by the methods they employ. Gaussian noise, white noise, salt and pepper noise, speckle noise, and poison noise were all removed from lung CT scans using a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs) in this study. Using TSVM, RNN can function better than ever before. The approach proposed here uses LSTM to normalize batches of data.

With accurate measurements, farmers can predict the yield of their crops and use this information for making informed management decisions, and breeders can use it for variety selection. Agricultural robotic applications promise to automate this monitoring task. In this paper, we address the problem of monitoring fruit growth and investigate the matching of fruits recorded in commercial greenhouses at different growth stages based on data recorded from terrestrial laser scanners. This is challenging as fruits appear highly similar, change over time, and are subject to severe occlusions. We first propose a fruit descriptor, which captures the topology of the fruit surroundings to facilitate the matching between different points in time. We capture and describe the relationship between a fruit and its neighbors such that our descriptors are less affected by the growth over time. Furthermore, we define a matching cost function and use an optimal assignment algorithm to match the fruit observations taken in different weeks.

Compared to traditional machine learning methods and CNN-based remote sensing image semantic segmentation models, the proposed model outperforms existing models regarding classification accuracy and model robustness. The OBViT model was applied to remote sensing crop classification tasks in the Xingren region of Guizhou, China, and its precision, recall, and f1-score reached 87.98%, 87.91%, and 86.56%, respectively. This study’s main contribution is designing a remote sensing image semantic segmentation model structure suitable for crop classification in the field by optimizing model components such as activation functions and optimizers and using a multi-scale training strategy during model training to improve performance. Specifically, the study used the SLIC algorithm to segment remote sensing images into uniformly sized superpixel objects for easier model input and performed multi-scale data augmentation on each object to increase data diversity. Additionally, the pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model was used to replace the CNN module in the OBCNN model, significantly improving classification accuracy. The Mish activation function was also used instead of the GELU activation function, and the Adan optimizer was used instead of the Adam optimizer to improve semantic segmentation accuracy further. Finally, the OBViT crop classification model was trained using manually annotated remote sensing datasets. An object-based K-nearest neighbor filtering algorithm was used for post-processing to improve semantic segmentation accuracy further. Experimental results demonstrate that the OBViT model achieves good semantic segmentation performance on crop remote sensing monitoring datasets, with higher accuracy and robustness than other deep learning methods. The land cover categories in the experimental dataset were tobacco, corn, barley rice, artificial buildings, and “other’’. The study also conducted an interpretability analysis on the model, revealing that OBViT can better capture different target categories’ spatial structure and texture features. Future research can explore the use of OBViT for more complex remote sensing image data and further optimize the model structure and training strategies to improve accuracy.

Here, the development of room-temperature detection of  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$  is demonstrated using 2-D molybdenum disulfide (MoS $_{{2}}{)}$  nanoflakes decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The high specific surface area and excellent physical and chemical properties of MoS2 facilitate abundant active sites for adsorbing  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$ , while the electron-donating effect of AuNPs modulates the electronic structure of MoS2 that can help to realize high sensitivity even at low concentrations of  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$ . A facile solvent exfoliation method is utilized for preparing 2-D MoS2 nanoflakes and then functionalized with AuNPs. The MoS2-AuNPs sensor shows a 58% enhancement in sensor response for  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$  at room temperature compared to pristine MoS2 gas sensors due to the n-doping effect of AuNPs. Furthermore, the sensor can detect  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$  levels as low as 0.5 ppm. Additionally, the incorporation of AuNPs on MoS2 nanoflakes improves the selectivity toward  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$  against a variety of interfering gases, including ammonia, nitric oxide, ethylene, and carbon dioxide. The possible reason could be that the dominant chemisorption of  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$  on AuNPs-decorated MoS2 is more prevalent than that of other gases. Besides the enhanced response and excellent selectivity, the sensor shows good repeatability with a low relative standard deviation of 0.2% and stability over 30 days. Thus, this sensor could be a potential candidate for high-performance and room-temperature  $\text{N}_{{2}}\text{O}$  gas sensing applications.;1558-1748;;10.1109/JSEN.2023.3296504;"United States Department of Agriculture–National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA)(grant numbers:2020-67021-31528,2020-68013-30934,2022-67019-38686); Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institutes Program; NSF and USDA-NIFA under AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture(grant numbers:2021-67021-35329); Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190343;"Gas sensors;gold nanoparticles (AuNPs);molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflakes;nitrous oxide (N2O);transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)";"Sensors;Molybdenum;Temperature sensors;Sulfur;Gas detectors;Gold;Sensitivity";"adsorption;air pollution measurement;ammonia;carbon compounds;chemical variables measurement;chemisorption;gas sensors;gold;health and safety;molybdenum compounds;nanofabrication;nanoparticles;nanosensors;nitrogen compounds;semiconductor materials;transition metal dichalcogenides";"2-D molybdenum disulfide;2-D transition metal dichalcogenide;Au/el;CO2/bin;gas sensing applications;gas sensors;gold nanoparticles;greenhouse gas emissions mitigation;high specific surface area;high-sensitivity sensor;human health;MoS2/bin;N2O/bin;nanoflakes;nanoparticles;NH3/bin;NO/bin;room temperature gas sensing performance;room-temperature detection;room-temperature nitrous oxide sensor;sensor response;temperature 293.0 K to 298.0 K;time 30.0 d";;;;36;IEEE;21.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

To achieve this, we propose a simple yet effective interaction scheme, named Inside-Outside Guidance (IOG). Concretely, we leverage an inside point that is clicked near the object center and two outside points at the symmetrical corner locations (top-left and bottom-right or top-right and bottom-left) of an almost-tight bounding box that encloses the target object. The interaction results in a total of one foreground click and four background clicks for segmentation. The advantages of our IOG are four-fold: 1) the two outside points can help remove distractions from other objects or background; 2) the inside point can help eliminate the unrelated regions inside the bounding box; 3) the inside and outside points are easily identified, reducing the confusion raised by the state-of-the-art DEXTR Maninis et al. 2018, in labeling some extreme samples; 4) it naturally supports additional click annotations for further correction. Despite its simplicity, our IOG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on several popular benchmarks such as GrabCut Rother et al. 2004, PASCAL Everingham et al. 2010 and MS COCO Russakovsky et al. 2015, but also demonstrates strong generalization capability across different domains such as street scenes (Cityscapes Cordts et al. 2016), aerial imagery (Rooftop Sun et al. 2014 and Agriculture-Vision Chiu et al. 2020) and medical images (ssTEM Gerhard et al. 2013).

Ten geometrical parameters of a single Yagi-Uda antenna are selected to widen the 5G operating bandwidth (BW) and increase the gain together using the Kriging model builder and pipeline sequential design (PLSD) in combined sampling strategy. The single antenna element provides a wide impedance bandwidth (IBW) from 26 to 34 GHz with 20% and a peak measured gain of 5.5 dBi at frequency 28 GHz. The optimized antenna provides a high growth of 27.7% and a 2 dB increase in peak gain over the reference antenna without any effect on the structure design. Then, a low-bit phased array antenna with the optimized 5G Yagi-Uda antenna is designed and optimized with directional radiation in the horizontal plane for the 28 GHz base-station (BS) 5G applications. The array antenna consists of three sections: the Yagi-Uda antenna elements, Wilkinson power divider, and two bits phase shifters. The total size of the proposed array antenna is $60 \times 47\ \text{mm}^{2}$ and it operates in a measured frequency range of 26.2 to 29.1 GHz around an operating frequency of 28 GHz which provides 10.3% IBW, and a maximum measured gain is 14 dB. Finally, two analog and hybrid precoding methods are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed 5G phased array antenna. In the analog precoding, gain patterns are nearly constant in the range of $[-45^{\circ }, 45^{\circ }]$ with variations around 1 dB and the range for hybrid precoding, is $[-60^{\circ }, 60^{\circ }]$ with a very low sidelobe level (SLL).

A Unified Framework for Adversarial Attacks on Multi-Source Domain Adaptation;"J. Wu; J.

However, little effort has been devoted to studying the adversarial vulnerability of multi-source domain adaptation approaches. Specifically, most existing techniques focus on learning the domain-invariant representation to mitigate the distribution shift across domains. In this paper, we theoretically show that the domain-invariant representation cannot guarantee the success of multi-source domain adaptation, when no labeled samples are available in the target domain. This result motivates us to propose a unified framework (AdaptAttack) for data poisoning adversarial attacks on multi-source domain adaptation. The key idea is to maliciously manipulate the label-informed data distributions of source domains by injecting perceptibly unnoticeable noise into the source data. In addition, it requires that the generated adversarial attacks are invisible to multi-source domain adaptation algorithms, i.e., the source classification errors and marginal discrepancies across domains are not negatively affected. Extensive experiments on public domain adaptation benchmarks confirm the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed AdaptAttack framework in both white-box and black-box attack scenarios.;1558-2191;;10.1109/TKDE.2022.3230825;"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1947203,IIS-2117902,IIS-2137468); Agriculture and Food Research Initiative(grant numbers:2020-67021-32799/project accession no. 1024178); National Institute of Food and Agriculture; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9994047;"Adversarial attacks;multi-source domain adaptation;domain discrepancy";"Training;Adaptation models;Prediction algorithms;Robustness;Knowledge transfer;Minimization;Machine learning algorithms";"computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)";"AdaptAttack;adversarial attacks;distribution shift;domain-invariant representation;multiple labeled source domains;multisource domain adaptation algorithms;public domain adaptation benchmarks;source data;source domain label-informed data distributions;unlabeled target domain";;;;44;IEEE;20.12.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals
Activity Segmentation and Fish Tracking From Sonar Videos by Combining Artifacts Filtering and a Kalman Approach;"J. Winkler; S. Badri-Hoeher; F.

This is especially true for marine ecosystems, which are under multiple stresses. The cumulative effects of overexploitation, on the one hand, and the simultaneous manifestation of anthropogenic climate change, on the other, mean that fish stocks are the most endangered components of marine ecosystems. To minimize these vulnerabilities to marine ecosystems and ensure natural and sustainable resource use, monitoring systems must be placed in oceans and seas. Examples of the development of these monitoring systems are provided by the Underwater Fish Observatory (UFO) and UFOTriNet, two projects being conducted by several researchers from marine biology, engineering, and industry in Germany between 2014 and 2016 and between 2019 and 2023, respectively. The systems collect abiotic as well as camera and sonar data to count and analyze fish populations over the seasons. This work proposes a method for robust fish counting using sonar data, supplemented by camera data. To successfully accomplish this task, activity segmentation and object tracking are important steps. Background subtraction is often used as a pre-processing step for stationary sonars. Our proposed method improves this step by bandpass filtering considering the motion of all actors in the sonar data. For the segmentation step, our method uses a simple Gaussian distribution model with positional covariances which are computed directly from the intensity image. The tracking step is performed using a classical Kalman filter which estimates the velocity and position of each object in Cartesian coordinates. Sonar detections in close range of the observation area are compared with camera detections for validation. In addition, automated parameter optimization is used to maximize the correlation with the camera detections. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to the Caltech fish counting dataset and compared with a deep learning method based on YOLOv5. While YOLO is still superior in detection and counting metrics, the multi object tracking accuracy is somewhat higher with our method.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3294710;"German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) Based on a Decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the Innovation Support Program(grant numbers:2819111618); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179857;"Acoustical imaging;activity segmentation;computer vision;fish tracking;imaging sonar;underwater image processing";"Sonar;Radar tracking;Task analysis;Sonar detection;Image segmentation;Kalman filters;Acoustic imaging;Computer vision;Fish schools;Underwater tracking;Image processing";"aquaculture;band-pass filters;cameras;deep learning (artificial intelligence);ecology;feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;geophysical image processing;image segmentation;Kalman filters;object detection;object tracking;oceanographic techniques;optimisation;sonar detection;sonar imaging;video signal processing";"abiotic data;activity segmentation;anthropogenic climate change;artifacts filtering;automated parameter optimization;background subtraction;bandpass filtering;Caltech fish counting dataset;camera data;camera detections;Cartesian coordinates;classical Kalman filter;deep learning method;fish populations;fish stocks;fish tracking;Germany;highly dynamic systems;intensity image;Kalman approach;marine biology;marine ecosystems;monitoring systems;multiobject tracking accuracy;natural resource use;object tracking;positional covariances;robust fish counting;segmentation step;simple Gaussian distribution model;sonar data;sonar detections;sonar videos;stationary sonars;sustainable resource use;tracking step;UFO;UFOTriNet;Underwater Fish Observatory;YOLOv5";;;;27;CCBYNCND;12.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach in agriculture modeling: many studies have used convolutional(CNN) and recurrent neural networks(RNN) to effectively capture the nonlinear relationship between yield and various factors such as climate, soil and management. How-ever, these approaches often neglect the spatial relations among different prediction units. In this paper, we introduce Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) to incorporate spatial knowledge in crop yield forecasting. Additionally, a Topology-Feature Space Fusion Graph Neural Network(TFSF-GNN) is proposed to address the limitations of topological graphs based on geographical distance which include only the static spatial information. The network is designed to compute the similarity of meteorological and environmental characteristics in different regions and generates graph structures of the feature space. Multiple graph convolutional networks are then used to extract information from the topological space, feature space, and common space.

Energy-efficiency is achieved through delivering only the required net light intensity, consisting of sunlight and supplemental LED light, using an intelligent controller that does not depend on the lighting system model.

Experiments performed in a research greenhouse facility on the lettuce crop are presented which indicate that the system can deliver the desired Daily Light Integrals (DLIs) to the plants in the presence of changing daylight conditions. The proposed method can thus deliver the exact amount of light to a specific crop based on the required light recipes during different growth phases. The control performance is further compared with a conventional on-off time-scheduling method in terms of plant health, growth, and energy requirements.

Bit-Plane and Correlation Spatial Attention Modules for Plant Disease Classification;"X. Wang; W.

Therefore, some studies have utilized convolutional neural networks to identify categories of plant diseases, which can effectively reduce the reliance on crop experts. To further improve the accuracy of plant disease classification methods based on convolutional neural network, this paper proposes an attention model designed for plant disease classification tasks. The proposed attention model contains bit-plane attention and a correlation spatial attention. The bit-plane attention localizes disease areas by exploiting bit-plane information. The correlation spatial attention enhances the weight of important areas in the feature map by establishing the correlation between different areas. The accuracy of the proposed attention model inserted into ResNet101 on the AI Challenger 2018 and PlantVillage datasets is 87.11% and 99.82%, respectively. The performance is better than that of other methods studied on the public plant disease classification dataset. Experiments show that the proposed attention model outperforms the widely used universal attention models SE, CBAM, CA, ECA, BAM and GC. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to verify the influences of different variants of the proposed attention model on the results.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3309925;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10234387;"Image classification;plant disease classification;convolutional neural network;attention mechanism;bit-plane attention";"Plant diseases;Convolutional neural networks;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Crops;Convolutional neural networks;Correlation;Image classification";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;image classification;pattern classification;plant diseases";"attention model;bit-plane attention;bit-plane information;convolutional neural network;correlation spatial attention modules;disease areas;effective classification;plant disease classification methods;plant disease classification tasks;plant diseases;public plant disease classification dataset";;;;36;CCBYNCND;30.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

In order to take the appropriate steps to prevent the occurrence of plant leaf diseases, it is essential to track and recognize such infections during the planting period. However, correct recognition of numerous maize diseases is difficult to achieve because the currently employed automated solutions are operationally complicated or only effective on samples with plain backgrounds. While real-world scenarios are suffering from huge sample distortions like the effect of noise, clutter in the background, and blurring of the leaf regions that increase the complexity of the recognition procedure. To alleviate the above-listed problems, a deep learning (DL) approach called the MaizeNet is proposed for the correct localization and classification of various maize crop leaf disorders. We have presented an improved Faster-RCNN approach that utilizes the ResNet-50 model with spatial-channel attention as its base network for the computation of deep keypoints which are then localized and categorized into various classes. The proposed work is tested on a standard database named Corn Disease and Severity that contains samples from three different classes of maize plant diseases which are captured under diverse conditions such as complex background, brightness, and color and size variations.

Numerous studies have proposed techniques for the early detection and classification of biotic stress in coffee leaves. In this study, we propose a technique called extracted feature ensemble (EFE) for classifying healthy and infected classes. Transfer learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and custom-designed features are used to improve classification performance. Under the concept of EFE, three methodologies are proposed for evaluating various extracted feature combinations and determining the effect of dimensionality on the performance of the model. In addition, a semi-segmentation approach is used to guide the extraction of informative foreground details, while non-segmented inputs are used to improve the model’s robustness against complex background noise. By improving three open-source datasets for biotic stress categorization in coffee leaves, a new dataset was created and employed. The first proposed method, ECNN, focused on the effective concatenation of five CNNs and obtained a classification accuracy of 93.45% using a decision tree classifier, exceeding the maximum individual accuracy of 86.07% from Mobile-Net v3 features. In addition, the HLGGM method was investigated, which demonstrated an enhanced accuracy of 99.16% by combining dimension-reduced Mobile-Net v3 features with handcrafted features. HLGCM, the final approach represented, aimed at extracting features from dimensionality-reduced handmade and CNN-based data, and ultimately succeeded in accomplishing an accuracy of 99.49 percent by using decision tree model. The obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of feature concatenation in enhancing the classification model’s discriminative capabilities and classification accuracy. The appropriate combination of hand-made and CNN-based features gives better accuracy and interesting insights into the effect of feature reduction on model classification efficiency.

Prediction Model for the Stored-Grain Situation Risk Point Based on Broad Learning Network;"L. Feiyu; Q. Yao; F.

It is difficult for traditional machine learning methods to process large-scale stored-grain monitoring data, while deep learning methods have the problems of difficult model training and high resource consumption. To solve these problems, a risk prediction model for stored-grain situations was proposed based on a broad learning network. First, the concept of stored-grain risks was proposed and defined in three categories: low, medium, and high. Then, based on the existing broad learning network, two improved broad learning algorithms were proposed: an enhanced node incremental algorithm and an input data incremental algorithm. Based on the multi-modal features of stored-grain situation data, canonical correlation analysis is introduced to the feature extraction and fusion methods. Finally, an accurate prediction model of stored-grain risk based on improved broad learning and correlation analysis is constructed. The experimental results show that, compared to the traditional broad learning model, the two improved broad learning models improve the accuracy of stored-grain risk prediction by more than 2.3%. Meanwhile, compared with the existing deep learning models, the improved broad learning model reduces training time by more than 20 times without reducing the prediction accuracy and has better robustness. In short, the incremental learning training method can make the prediction accuracy of the broad learning model close to or reach the level of the deep learning model with the increase of training data, which proved that the proposed methods may be an effective alternative to deep learning models.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3300868;"Open Fund of the Key Laboratory of Grain Information Processing and Control(grant numbers:KFJJ-2021-103); Key Scientific Research Project Program of Universities of Henan Province(grant numbers:22A510014); Henan Province Colleges and Universities Young Backbone Teacher Funding Program(grant numbers:2020GGJS084); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198425;"Stored-grain risk point;broad learning network;multi-modal data;incremental learning;canonical correlation analysis";"Predictive models;Data models;Atmospheric modeling;Deep learning;Neural networks;Temperature distribution;Learning systems";"agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;food security;sensor fusion";"broad learning algorithms;broad learning model;correlation analysis;deep learning methods;deep learning model;deep learning models;enhanced node incremental algorithm;feature extraction;fusion methods;grain security;incremental learning training method;input data incremental algorithm;large-scale stored-grain monitoring data;prediction accuracy;risk point;risk prediction model;stored-grain risk prediction;stored-grain situation data;traditional broad learning model";;;;38;CCBYNCND;1.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

The research on the fluctuation of soybean futures price and the prediction of the future price trend has always been the focus of extensive attention in the field of agricultural economics. This paper proposes an EEMD-NAGU hybrid prediction model for soybean futures price based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and New Attention Gate Unit (NAGU). The model first uses EEMD to process soybean futures price data into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and residual sequence. Then calculates the sample entropy of each IMF and reconstructed the IMF into three components of low-frequency, medium-frequency, and high-frequency, according to the size of the sample entropy. NAGU is formed by embedding the Attention mechanism (Attention) into the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) structure, further improving the learning capability of the model. NAGU splits the original reset gate and update gate, sets up two-stage respectively, and uses different activation functions to capture the information in historical data better. Soybean futures price data is complex nonlinearities and contain more noise. In this model, EEMD plays denoises the time series data and fixes the model input. NAGU can perform differential learning on data and finally produce prediction results. EEMD-NAGU is compared with thirteen other prediction models (Support Vector Regression (SVR), LSTM, GRU, NAGU, EEMD-LSTM, EEMD-GRU, EEMD-NGU, Attention-LSTM, Attention-GRU, Attention-NGU, EEMD-Attention-LSTM, EEMD-Attention-GRU, and EEMD-Attention-NGU). The evaluation indexes of the experiment are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and R Squared ( $R^{2}$ ). The experimental results show that the EEMD-NAGU model outperforms other models with better prediction performance.

One of them is coffee leaf rust which is caused by the fungus known asHemileia vastatrix and affects many coffee-growing regions.If not detected early enough it can greatly reduce coffee yield or worse wipe out an entire plantation affecting the farmers. This study proposes a methodology for detecting coffee leaf rust disease using computer vision and employs multiple pre-trained architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, this study used twenty-five convolutional neural networks, and the best-performing models are ResNet101V2, InceptionV3, ResNet50V2, Xception, and DenseNet169. They have a training accuracy of 92.62%, 96.90%, 93.45%, 98.45%, and 96.79% respectively. Meanwhile, their validation accuracy is 91.67%, 90%, 94.44%, 93.89%, and 95.56% respectively. Out of the top five CNNs, ResNet101V2 achieved the highest test accuracy with 95.56% and it also excels in other evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 – score. Although this study used a variety of CNNs, it is also recommended to use more types of algorithms as well as increase the number of epochs. Future studies can also consider the detection of other coffee diseases and a larger dataset for a wider scope. Overall, the result of this study is a step closer to achieving improved coffee production and the livelihoods of farmers.;;979-8-3503-2130-2;10.1109/I2CACIS57635.2023.10193074;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10193074;"CNN;transfer learning;coffee leaf rust detection;ResNet;DenseNet;EfficientNet;MobileNet;NASNet;VGG;InceptionV3;Xception";"Training;Measurement;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Production;Computer architecture;Agriculture";"beverages;botany;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;image classification;plant diseases;plantations";"2.5 cups;coffee diseases;coffee leaf rust detection;coffee leaf rust disease;coffee plants;coffee yield;coffee-growing regions;Convolutional Neural network architectures;convolutional neural networks;improved coffee production;ResNet101V2;ResNet50V2";;;;13;IEEE;31.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The production of mycotoxins by these fungi is heavily influenced by the substrate, and also by environmental factors such as high levels of temperature and humidity, conditions worsened nowadays by the ongoing climate change on a global scale. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most abundant food-contaminating mycotoxins produced by species belonging to Aspergillus and Penicillium genera and the main mycotoxin present in grapes on whose pericarp usually fungi are present. During the harvest, the permanence of the grapes in the field could induce the production of OTA which, consequently, may contaminate future grape products such as wine, grape juice and dried vine fruit. In this paper, we propose an electronic solution based on Internet of Things (IoT) devices and powered by artificial intelligence.

This study aimed to optimize initial multiple bubbles design and find the dominant parameters for efficient microjet generation. For this purpose, the bubble design was optimized using an evolutionary algorithm—the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. In addition, the dataset of solutions obtained through the optimization process was analyzed via principal component analysis (PCA). The optimization and analysis revealed that a higher microjet velocity could be obtained when a single bubble was generated near the tube wall, and an optimal total bubble volume was observed corresponding to this optimization. In addition, this approximate optimal solution we obtained was confirmed to reduce 88% of total initial energy compared to that of the typical solution.

However, existing methods for soil texture classification rely on soil images taken under controlled conditions, which are not scalable for high spatiotemporal mapping of soil texture and fail to reflect real-world challenges and variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, scalable, and high spatial resolution soil surface texture classification process that employs image processing, texture-enhancing filters, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify soil images captured under Uncontrolled Field Conditions (UFC). The proposed process involves a series of steps for improving soil image analysis. Initially, image segmentation is utilized to eliminate non-soil pixels and prepare the images for further processing. Next, the segmented output is divided into smaller tiles to isolate relevant soil pixels. Then, high-frequency filtering is introduced to enhance the texture of the images. Our research has shown that the Gabor filter is more effective than Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for this purpose. By creating four distinct Gabor filters, we can enhance specific, hidden patterns within the soil images. Finally, the split and enhanced images are used to train CNN classifiers for optimal analysis. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using different metrics and compare it to existing state-of-the-art soil texture classification frameworks. Our proposed soil texture classification process improves performance. We employed various CNN architectures in our proposed process for comparison purposes. Inception v3 produces the highest accuracy of 85.621%, an increase of 12% compared to other frameworks.

In recent decades, Bangladesh has seen a surge in the popularity of potato farms. Nonetheless, farmer’s expenses in potato production are rising as a result of a number of illnesses. Nonetheless, the high cost of potato production is mostly attributable to a number of illnesses that are affecting the crop. Which is wreaking havoc on the farmer’s schedule. In order to modernize the potato industry and speed up disease diagnosis, automation has been implemented. In spite of the claims to the contrary, potato leaf disease is a serious problem that can severely reduce crop yields. The leaves of diseased potato plants will show symptoms of early blight, Septoria blight, late blight, and other diseases. If such outbreaks are discovered at the initial level and enough intervention is done, the farmer will not be at risk of incurring significant economic losses. Based on the results of this study, a new model is presented for accurately identifying and detecting illnesses in potato leaf stands using image processing. While there are several methods that may be utilized in machine learning, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is what’s being employed here to identify the disease in potato leaf photos.

One of the methods that such losses can be prevented is by identifying and responding to the same appropriately and swiftly. Given that a majority of farmers in developing countries cannot afford specialist help for the same, and the fact that manual identification of disease in wheat is a challenging task to begin with, this problem may be aided by using computer vision methods to identify the diseases, after which the farmer needs to only refer to expert sources for solutions. This can greatly reduce the challenge and costs, as well as increase the availability of specialists to deal with the same.

The purpose of this work is to categorize 14 classes for both cotton and tomato crops, with 12 diseased classes and two healthy classes using a deep learning-based lightweight 2D CNN architecture and to implement the model in an android application named “Plant Disease Classifier” for smartphone-assisted plant disease diagnosis system, the results of the experiments reveal that the proposed model outperforms the pre-trained models VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV3 despite having fewer parameters. With slightly larger parameters than MobileNet and MobileNetV2, proposed model also attains considerably larger accuracy than these models. The classification accuracy varies between 57% and 92% for these models, and the proposed model’s average accuracy is 97.36%. Also, the precision, recall, F1-score of the proposed model is 97 % and Area Under Curve (AUC) score of the model is 99.9% which is an indicator of the very good performance of the model. Class activation maps were shown using the Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to visually explain the disease detected by the proposed model, and a heatmap was produced to indicate the responsible region for classification. The app works very impressively and classified the correct disease in a shorter period of time of about 4.84 ms due to the lightweight nature of the model.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3320686;"Qatar National Library (QNL); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10267978;"Convolution neural network (CNN);lightweight 2D CNN;android application;plant disease diagnosis system;gradient weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM);tomato;cotton";"Cotton;Crops;Feature extraction;Plant diseases;Convolutional neural networks;Deep learning;Computer science";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;cotton;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;pattern classification;plant diseases;smart phones";"cash crop;cotton;crop;deep learning-based lightweight 2D CNN architecture;diseased classes;dual-crop diseases;gradient weighted class activation mapping technique;healthy classes;plant disease classifier;productivity;smartphone-assisted plant disease diagnosis system;sweet potato;tomato crops";;1;;39;CCBY;29.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Theoretically, synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) offers the possibility to solve the layover problem, making it possible to estimate the elevation of scatters located in the same resolution cell. This article describes a deep learning approach, named tomographic SAR neural network (TSNN), which aims at reconstructing forest and ground height using multipolarimetric multibaseline (MPMB) SAR data and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based data. The reconstruction of the forest and ground height is formulated as a classification problem, in which TSNN, a feedforward network, is trained using covariance matrix elements as input vectors and quantized LiDAR-based data as the reference. In our work, TSNN is trained and tested with P-band MPMB data acquired by ONERA over Paracou region of French Guiana in the frame of the European Space Agency’s campaign TROPISAR and LiDAR-based data provided by the French Agricultural Research Center. The novelty of the proposed TSNN is related to its ability to estimate the height with a high agreement with LiDAR-based measurement and actual height with no requirement for phase calibration. Experimental results of different covariance window sizes are included to demonstrate that TSNN conducts height measurement with high spatial resolution and vertical accuracy outperforming the other two TomoSAR methods. Moreover, the conducted experiments on the effects of phase errors in different ranges show that TSNN has a good tolerance for small errors and is still able to precisely reconstruct forest heights.;1558-0644;;10.1109/TGRS.2023.3274395;"Italian Space Agency (ASI) through “MEFISTO—Metodi di Elaborazione di dati SAR multi-Frequenza per Il monitoraggio del disseSTO idrogeologico” within the Framework of BANDO(grant numbers:ASI DC-UOT-2019-017); “Studio di nuovi metodi e tecniche basati sull’utilizzo di dati sar multimissione/multifrequenza”(grant numbers:ASI N. 2021-10-UO,CUP n.

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L) is one of the majorly farmed vegetable food crops in worldwide. The output of potato crops in both quality and quantity is affected majorly due to fungal blight infections, which causes a severe impact on the global food yield. The most severe foliar diseases for potato crops are early blight and late blight. The causes of these diseases are Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestants respectively. Farmers suspect such problems by focusing on the color change or transformation in potato leaves, which is effortless due to subjectivity and lengthy time commitment.

For water resource management, prediction is a key to mitigate and regulate expected economic losses and property damages. This paper compares two supervised machine learning (ML) techniques: support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) to predict SM. In RStudio, various meteorological variables: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall are trained to estimate SM. For eight divisions, SM and weather variables are obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER). The experiments include daily observations for 39 (1982 to 2020) to develop SVR and RF models. To estimate SM from the predictive model, datasets from diverse regions: Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Chittagong, and Sylhet are utilized in training (60%) and Rangpur, Barisal, Khulna, and Dhaka are segregated for validation (40%) resulting in accuracy of 88 to 95.8%. This model further is applied to forecast daily SM for each city including two districts (Bogra and Jessore) and found slightly higher model performance for SVR (90.7%) than RF (90.1%) on average (Year: 2021).

A large number of insect species and the subtle differences bring a challenge to the accurate recognition of pests. Many studies tackle the challenge of pest recognition through deep neural networks (DNNs) and achieve significant success in terms of accuracy. However, the complex structure and a large number of parameters make DNNs difficult for end users to understand the reasons for the decision of models, which causes distrust in the classification of harmful insects and overuse of insecticides. To address the lack of explainability of DNNs, we propose an explanation generation workflow to generate concept-based explanations for pest recognition. Specifically, the concept extraction method uses a clustering algorithm to extract image segments with meaningful concepts from a portion of the training dataset. Then, concept models are trained to detect the presence of concepts in the image. Finally, the explanation generation method provides concept-based global and local explanations in the form of weighted directed graphs and concept importances, respectively. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, the proposed workflow extracts meaningful concepts for pest recognition effectively and detects the presence of concepts in images.;2378-363X;978-1-6654-9313-0;10.1109/INDIN51400.2023.10217975;"Innovate UK; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10217975;"Explainable machine learning;Concept-based explanation;Deep neural networks;Pest recognition";"Training;Image segmentation;Visualization;Analytical models;Image recognition;Statistical analysis;Insects";"agriculture;deep learning (artificial intelligence);directed graphs;explanation;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;pattern clustering;pest control";"agricultural food industry products;automatic generation;concept extraction method;concept importances;concept models;DNNs;explanation generation method;explanation generation workflow;pest management;pest recognition;visual concept-based explanations;workflow extracts meaningful concepts";;;;22;IEEE;22.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The coffee plant has experienced significant damage as a result of a White Stem Borer (WSB) bug. The WSB bores into the coffee stem and stays buried there until the plant fully falls. As it is challenging to diagnose the disease in the early stages of its infestation, this disease greatly distresses coffee growers. In order to find a way to prevent the significant yield loss, we built on a dataset of WSB-infected stems, identified 3 distinct features to classify infected coffee stems and distinguish them from healthy stems, and then trained YoloV5 deep learning model. We developed a model using augmented images from the existing image data after dividing it into training and testing sets. mAP, precision, and recall of 81.9, 89.7 and 73.8 percentages respectively were obtained, which would increase substantially with larger data size.

Nutrient deficient plants exhibit certain symptoms and may provide poor yields. So continual observation is required to determine the nutritional condition of plants without any human effort. The three important macronutrients that plants need for proper growth and development are represented by the letters NPK, which stand for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These nutrients are essential for photosynthesis, root growth, energy transmission, and general plant health. NPK deficiency may harm plants, causing slowed development, yellowing or purplishing of the leaves, brittle stems, and decreased yield. It requires careful monitoring for recognizing symptoms and doing soil testing to establish the availability of certain nutrients in order to pinpoint specific nutrient deficits. Many techniques may be used to correct NPK deficits. Identifying NPK deficiencies in plants using AI can be achieved through image recognition and analysis techniques.

The model performed well for all customers in the local results and analysis, with an accuracy hovering around 0.98. The highest severity level often had the most excellent accuracy, recall, and F1-Score, indicating skill in spotting the worst parsley leaf infections.

To address the problems of intra- and inter-class multi-scale variation, complex background interference, and difficulty in mobile model deployment faced by tomato leaf disease identification, we propose a lightweight Ghost Dense network (LGDNet) to identify diseases of tomato leaves. First, we replace the standard convolution of the bottleneck layer in DenseNet with the Ghost module, which compresses the network size while maintaining the model's adaptability to the multi-scale variation of tomato leaf diseases. Then, we propose a lightweight and efficient coordinate multidimensional information fusion attention (CMIFA) module that enhances feature extraction for tomato leaves and enables the model to locate the diseased areas more accurately.

Wheat ears are the key to predicting and evaluating wheat yields, so fast and accurate wheat ear detection on mobile devices and wheat yield counting are of great importance for modern, intelligent agricultural mass production. There are many problems with detecting wheat ears: wheat is densely distributed, overlapping and obscuring each other, leading to error and miss detection; wheat is not easy to distinguish from complex weed backgrounds; and the appearance of wheat ears varies depending on the growth period, color and type of wheat they are in. Existing target detection algorithms have problems such as large models, high computing requirements and long computation times, which are not suitable for configuration on portable devices for real-time field calculations. In order to achieve real-time detection counting in the field, it is crucial to ensure the accuracy of model detection while reducing the number of parameters and computation time.In this paper, Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) is selected as the dataset, and after comparing YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, YOLOv8, which is superior in comprehensive model size and accuracy, is chosen as the baseline, and the n-model with smaller model depth and convolution channel is selected. Due to the dense and small size of wheat ears in the dataset, the feature information is lost after repeated downsampling, and it is difficult for the P5 layer detection head with lower resolution to detect the information of small targets. Therefore, the P5 feature layer is removed, and the P3 and P4 feature layers, which contain more target information with less downsampling, are used for feature extraction, which can focus more on the detection of small targets of wheat ears and also reduce the model size. Replacing the Conv in the network with a lightweight convolutional layer, Depthwise Conv, lightens the model, reduces the model size, decreases the number of model parameters, and speeds up the detection. The improved method achieves an average accuracy (mAP@0.5) of 94.3%, and the model size, number of parameters and FPS reach 3.19 MB, 6.2 GFLOPs and 300, respectively. The improved method proposed in this paper reduces the model size, decreases the number of parameters and speeds up the model detection without degrading the accuracy. In the future, the model can be further deployed to mobile devices for real-time wheat spike detection in the field, which can predict the wheat yield in a certain area.";;979-8-3503-0351-3;10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics59224.2023.10233526;"Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10233526;"wheat;YOLOv8;light;multi-scale;Depthwise Conv";"Mass production;Computational modeling;Food security;Ear;Object detection;Predictive models;Feature extraction";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;data analysis;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;object detection";"comprehensive model size;convolution channel;global wheat head detection;miss detection;real-time wheat spike detection;target detection algorithms;wheat ears;wheat yield counting;YOLOv5;YOLOv7;YOLOv8";;;;21;IEEE;1.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Early detection and accurate classification of the disease severity are essential for effective disease management. In the proposed work, a hybrid model using Faster region based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) has been developed and support vector machine (SVM) for the detection and classification of wheat leaf spot disease. We collected a dataset of 10,000 images and performed binary classification to distinguish between healthy and diseased wheat leaves, achieving an accuracy of 96.63%. We also conducted multi-classification to categorize the disease severity of the wheat leaves into five different levels, achieving an accuracy of 96.33%. The results of our study demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid model in accurately detecting and classifying wheat leaf spot disease. The high accuracy achieved in both binary and multi-class classification indicates that the model is robust and reliable. The agricultural industry can benefit significantly from our findings since the precise classification and timely identification of plant diseases can prevent substantial crop damage.

Phenotyping typically involves the initial capture of high-resolution images of the plant of interest and the subsequent measurement of different morphometric parameters of specific plant organs. This second step is typically very time consuming and difficult to automate. To deal with this bottleneck, we developed a multi-class segmentation model based on U-shape network to identify hypocotyls and roots of young seedlings of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We applied a balanced cross entropy loss function to learn an alternative optimal network structure for this multi-class segmentation task. We evaluated our segmentation machine using 66 images of the wild-type Arabidopsis strain Col-0, as well as 34 images of the highly agravitropic and morphologically distinct mutant strain, aux1-7. Our model achieved a mean BFscore of 0.81 for Col-0 seedlings and 0.75 for aux1-7 mutant seedlings on the test dataset. Our model was also able to maintain accuracy in these two morphologically different genotypes suggesting that our segmentation procedure could be successfully applied to Arabidopsis seedlings showing broad morphological differences due to their genotype or treatment conditions. Appropriate segmentation is the first step in identifying phenotypic changes under hormone-mediated stress response. The identified growth parameters will be useful to identify the response associated with both abiotic and biotic stresses, which include but not limited to drought stress, heat stress, and the presence of pests or pathogens. The quantification of these parameters will aid assessment of genetic factors that contribute to the stress response.;;979-8-3503-9787-1;10.1109/ICBCB57893.2023.10246729;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246729;"Multi-class segmentation;plant phenotype;U-Net;encoder-decoder;deep learning";"Training;Image segmentation;Plants (biology);Biological systems;Genetics;Entropy;Biochemistry";"botany;cellular biophysics;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);entropy;genetic engineering;genetics;image classification;image segmentation;molecular biophysics;seeds (agriculture)";"abiotic factors;abiotic stresses;agravitropic strain;alternative optimal network structure;aux1-7 mutant seedlings;balanced cross entropy loss function;biotic factors;biotic stresses;dark-grown arabidopsis seedlings;deep learning;genetic factors;genotypes;high-resolution images;hormone-mediated stress response;hypocotyls;identified growth parameters;initial capture;morphologically distinct mutant strain;morphometric parameters;multiclass segmentation model;phenotypic changes;plant growth;plant organ phenotyping;reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana;segmentation machine;specific plant organs;subsequent measurement;U-net;U-shape network;wild-type Arabidopsis strain Col-0;young seedlings";;;;23;IEEE;15.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Accurately and timely detecting paddy rice planting extent is critical to ensure food security. China, with its vast territory ranging from tropical to subarctic regions, has significant differences in rice cultivation across regions. Traditional methods generally rely on field surveys to collect real sample points and use multi-temporal remote sensing images combined with machine learning to extract rice planting areas in a single climate zone, resulting in high accuracy. However, this approach requires a large number of high-quality samples, and is limited in terms of research area, which is not conducive to large-scale. In this study, we proposed a novel method for extracting rice using high spatio-temporal resolution of Sentinel-1/2 remote sensing images and transfer learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Firstly we use sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 remote sensing image, with pre-procession and computation, obtaining the dense time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and backscattering data (VH) datasets. Using the above datasets, we designed a rice extraction feature suitable for multiple climate zones, and multiple planting rhythms based on the characteristics of rice in flooding periods, multi-season growth, and the characteristics of different varieties of rice combined with rice phenological characteristics. And then, according to the rice phenological characteristics and rice planting rhythm, we select the several suitable time windows and growth time such as start of the growing season (SOS) and length of the growing season (LOS) for rice extraction to integrate the rice extraction feature set. To achieve high-precision extraction of rice in a large scale, we proposed a transfer learning-based method. Specifically, we first fuse a small amount of field data and a large number of supplementary samples from high precision rice extraction results we have had, resulting a big-data sample set. Then we use a transfer learning domain adaption method-TrAdaboost to calculate sample weights according to their adaptation to the characteristics of rice in large regions. Finally, we train the random forest model with weighted sample set, and obtain the large-scale rice extraction results. The results showed that our method outperformed traditional methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency in a large area, with an overall accuracy of 90% This method provides a reference for extracting rice planting areas, ensuring agricultural production and food security.;;979-8-3503-0351-3;10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics59224.2023.10233278;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10233278;"paddy rice;transfer learning;phenology;TrAdaboost;Google Earth Engine";"Earth;Transfer learning;Time series analysis;Food security;Crops;Feature extraction;Data mining";"agriculture;crops;feature extraction;floods;food security;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);random forests;remote sensing;time series;vegetation mapping";"backscattering data;China;Google Earth Engine platform;multitemporal remote sensing images;NDVI;normalized difference vegetation index;paddy rice planting extent;random forest model;rice cultivation;rice extraction feature;rice growing season;rice phenological characteristics;rice planting areas;rice planting rhythm;time series Sentinel images;TrAdaboost;transfer learning algorithm;transfer learning domain adaption method";;;;27;IEEE;1.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

It is still difficult to find accurate information about global economic livelihoods, especially in underdeveloped nations. To assess poverty levels, this article suggests a unique method that makes use of deep learning and satellite imagery. It is possible to identify economic activity and use it as a measure of poverty by analyzing satellite photos taken during both day and night. This strategy provides a practical and affordable means to collect data about poverty, particularly in areas where conventional data-gathering techniques are not feasible. For this strategy to operate, a Faster Regional-Convolutional Neural Network model must be trained to understand important developmental criteria such as rooftop type, illumination sources, closeness to water sources, agricultural areas, and industrial areas. Policymakers may develop a thorough grasp of the extent of poverty in various places by fusing these factors with socioeconomic data. With a high degree of accuracy, the model determines the average of the variables under observation. For enhancing our comprehension of poverty and enabling focused measures to reduce it, this combination of deep learning and satellite images shows significant potential.;2768-5330;979-8-3503-9725-3;10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142570;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142570;"Poverty Levels;Satellite Imagery;Data Augmentation;Deep Learning;Deep Neural Network";"Location awareness;Deep learning;Economics;Satellites;Statistical analysis;Neural networks;Object detection";"agriculture;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing";"conventional data-gathering techniques;deep learning;enabling focused measures;equitable resource distribution;Faster Regional-Convolutional Neural Network model;global economic livelihoods;poverty levels;satellite imagery-based prediction;satellite images;satellite photos;successful poverty reduction measures";;;;15;IEEE;8.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Although due to plant diseases losses arise in terms of quality as well as quantity of agricultural products. In order to avoid plant diseases, it is quite necessary that they be supervised from the very beginning of the life cycle. Farmers usually observe the plants using their naked-eye which takes too much time as well as additional costs are incurred with requirement for expertise. Due to this there arises a need to automate the disease detection system that helps us automate and fasten this process using modern techniques. We present a method for identifying plant leaf diseases using the “You Only Look Once” (YOLO) algorithm in this paper. This object detection technique divides images into grids, with each cell responsible for detecting objects within its designated region. To enable real-time detection, the YOLO algorithm utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Also, we evaluated the performance of Yolov5 and Yolov7 on the Plantdoc dataset. Both algorithms are single stage object detectors. We found that Yolov7 requires significantly more processing power than Yolov5 during training. Additionally, we observed that the performance of Yolov7 is not consistent, as the mAP values fluctuated more per epoch. In contrast, Yolov5 performed much better.;2157-0485;979-8-3503-4842-2;10.1109/ICETET-SIP58143.2023.10151484;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10151484;"Deep Learning;plant disease;YOLO;CNN;real-time;object detection";"Training;Plant diseases;Training data;Object detection;Detectors;Information processing;Real-time systems";"agricultural products;agriculture;convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;gradient methods;image classification;image enhancement;object detection;plant diseases";"additional costs;agricultural products;agricultural yield;deep learning;disease detection system;diseases losses;Indian economy;life cycle;multiclass plant disease detection;naked-eye;object detection technique divides images;performance analysis;plant diseases;plant leaf diseases;real-time detection;real-time object detection algorithm;single stage object detectors;YOLO algorithm;Yolov5;Yolov7;You Only Look Once algorithm";;;;40;IEEE;19.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

This research emphasises on critical supply chain management for the success of many sectors and importance of protecting the visibility of the overall process. The suggested system design creates a multimode storage management that offers increased visibility, safety, and productivity in the supply chain for processed foods by combining the strengths of both traditional storage and blockchain storage. There are various benefits to using blockchain-based in the supply chain for packaged foods. It ensures the transparency of the entire process and removes the need of middlemen, lowering the danger of fraud or manipulation. Additionally, blockchain technology's ability to track food goods accurately from the farm to the customer makes it simpler to identify the source of food products in the event of a food safety concern. In addition to shielding consumers from potential health risks, this also preserves the industry's good name. Blockchain transactions' automatic and secure replaces with traditional human procedures, speed up transaction processing, and shorten the time it takes for food products to get to consumers. As a result, consumers may be more satisfied and food suppliers and manufacturers may incur cheaper expenses. In order to enhance the supply chain for processed foods, this system suggests a system architecture that combines the advantages of blockchain technology and machine learning models.

Consequently, there is a great need for automatic plant disease identification and diagnosis in the realm of agricultural informatics. Many approaches have been put forth to solve this problem, but deep learning is quickly winning popularity due to its outstanding results. In this study, we assess the transfer learning capabilities of deep convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis of plant leaf diseases. We also consider how well the trained model will perform when applied to the specific task identified by our own data. One of the deep learning methods, the convolutional neural network algorithm (CNN), has been successfully applied to solve computer vision issues such as image classification, object segmentation, picture analysis, etc. In our study, we apply the Densenet201, Xception, InceptionResnetv2, NasNetMobile and VGG-16, hybrid with Support vector machine (SVM) along with a transfer learning approach to recognize diseases in images of different leaves. Instead of starting the training from scratch and arbitrarily initializing the weights, we use the pre-trained networks on the large labelled dataset, ImageNet, to build the weights. The proposed method's validity is supported by experimental findings, and it effectively detects plant diseases. The suggested method significantly outperforms other cutting-edge approaches in terms of performance like (F-scores of 0.93) for VGGG16+SVM, (F-score: 0.97) for DenseNet201+SVM, (F-score: 0.87) for Xception+SVM, (F-score: 0.97) for InceptionResnetv2+SVM, and (F-score: 0.93) NasNetMobile+SVM hybrid model on the dataset of plant images.;;978-93-80544-47-2;;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10112409;"deep neural network;transfer Learning;machine learning;support vector machine";"Support vector machines;Deep learning;Training;Plant diseases;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Production";"agriculture;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image classification;image segmentation;object detection;plant diseases;support vector machines";"agricultural informatics;automatic plant disease diagnosis;automatic plant disease identification;CNN;computer vision;deep convolutional neural networks;deep learning;DenseNet201;F-score;grain harvest;hybrid models;image classification;ImageNet;InceptionResnetv2;NasNetMobile;object segmentation;picture analysis;plant disease detection;plant images;plant leaf diseases;pre-trained networks;support vector machine;SVM;transfer learning;VGG-16;Xception";;;;41;;4.5.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Effective illness management and reduction depend on early identification and severity level categorization. This research provides a brand-new FL-CNN model for categorizing mango leaf diseases into four severity categories. The FL-CNN model allows training to be distributed across several clients without compromising data privacy. The suggested model consistently outperforms all clients in identifying the four severity levels of mango leaf diseases. The model's efficiency across customers with various data distributions is shown using macro, weighted, and micro-averaging techniques. Client 4 had the greatest macro average (96.11), weighted average (96.09), and micro average (96.08) values, while Client 1 had the lowest macro average (93.92), weighted average (93.96), and micro average (93.96) values. These findings show that the FL-CNN model successfully recognizes and categorizes various degrees of mango leaf disease severity, making it an invaluable tool for practical agricultural applications. Utilizing federated learning provides data privacy while offering a scalable and safe method for managing plant diseases.

Still, this resource's availability is limited and strongly affected by the climatic conditions of the area where the crops are located. Because of this situation, Energy-Water Management Systems have been implemented to optimize the use of resources for operating an irrigation system, while avoiding the over-extraction of water from the aquifer. However, these controllers require accurate future predictions of the climatic variables, which usually have a strong stochastic behavior. Therefore, this work proposes a Robust Energy-Water Management System based on prediction interval models to handle the uncertainty generated by the behavior of these climatic signals and the scarcity of accurate data for training the models. This work first analyzes available data from different sources to select the proper dataset for each climatic variable. Then, prediction intervals based on deep learning and fuzzy models are constructed for modeling solar radiation, air temperature, and precipitations. Using the information provided by the intervals, the proposed robust predictive controller is implemented and compared for two different cases, a conventional controller that uses the expected values of the climatic variables and a hypothetical ideal case where the controller knows the future with exact precision. Simulation results show that the prediction intervals based on deep learning and fuzzy models can reach good results for modeling these meteorological signals. Additionally, the proposed controller succeeds in maintaining the crops alive with the water available while getting a crop's profit close to the value achieved in the hypothetical ideal case. One of the main conclusions of this work is the importance that has the process of adequately analyzing different interval methods and data sources for achieving accurate models for climatic variables. Also, the quality of the interval models has an essential role in the controller for reaching results close to the ideal case, despite the stochasticity and uncertainty of the predicted signals.;2161-4407;978-1-6654-8867-9;10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191862;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191862;"Deep Learning;Model Predictive Control;Energy-Water Management System;Robust Control";"Deep learning;Training;Uncertainty;Atmospheric modeling;Soft sensors;Crops;Predictive models";"agriculture;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);fuzzy control;groundwater;irrigation;predictive control;robust control;water resources";"accurate future predictions;climatic conditions;climatic signals;climatic variables;crops;data sources;deep learning;energy-water management systems;fuzzy models;hypothetical ideal case;interval methods;irrigation system;predicted signals;prediction interval models;robust energy-water management system;robust predictive controller;stochastic behavior;water resources";;;;36;IEEE;2.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Therefore, this study employed a Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) model using seven morphological features of two varieties of raisins grown in Turkey. Initially, different machine learning techniques were employed on data. After that, four priors, such as Jefferys, Laplace, Cauchy, and Gaussian, were considered, and hyperparameters were tuned using the empirical Bayes method. Marginal posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated, and the convergence of the models was checked. Then, evaluation metrics of the BLR model with different priors were compared to those of machine learning models. According to the results, the BLR model with Gaussian prior produced the highest accuracy of 93%. Finally, it can be concluded that the BLR model with Gaussian prior provides substantially better results when classifying raisin data.;2613-8662;979-8-3503-4145-4;10.1109/SCSE59836.2023.10215003;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215003;"Bayesian classification;Bayesian logistic regression;classification;machine learning;raisin";"Measurement;Logistic regression;Uncertainty;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Data models;Bayes methods";"agricultural products;agriculture;Bayes methods;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);logistic regression";"agricultural markets;Bayesian logistic regression model;BLR model;Cauchy prior;commodity economy;empirical Bayes method;Gaussian prior;Jefferys prior;Laplace prior;low-quality raisin products;machine learning techniques;marginal posterior distributions;morphological features;raisin data classification;Turkey";;;;46;IEEE;17.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

At the same time, the deep separable convolutional DWConv is introduced into the YOLOv5 detection head network to realize the separation of convolutional channels and regions. The Loss function was replaced by EIOU and Focal Loss was introduced to optimize the sample imbalance in the bounding box regression task. In the post-processing stage, Soft-NMS was used to replace NMS, which solved the problem of wheat missing detection caused by violent rejection detection box. These improvements significantly simplified the size of the model, further improved the detection accuracy of wheat stripe rust, and effectively overcame the problem of missing detection of target wheat. The experimental results show that the mAP of the improved YOLOv5s model on the test data set reaches 87.53%, which is better than 86.2% of the initial YOLOv5s network and Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4 and SSD networks. In addition, the size of the improved YOLOv5s model is only 6.7MB, which is significantly reduced from the 14.8MB of the original YOLOv5s model, greatly improving the detection speed of the model for wheat stripe rust, and making it easier to deploy to farmland UAV equipment.

In particular, the relationship among meteorological, agricultural, and groundwater droughts needs to be characterized under different drought conditions. In this study, a probabilistic framework was developed for analyzing the spatio-temporal propagation of droughts and applied to South Korea. Three drought indices were calculated using satellite data and a deep learning model to determine the spatial and temporal extents of drought. The average propagation times were calculated. The time from meteorological to agricultural drought (MD-to-AD) was 2.83 months, and that from meteorological to groundwater drought (MD-to-GD) was 4.34 months. Next, the joint distribution among three drought types based on the best-fit copula functions was constructed. The conditional probabilities of drought occurrence were calculated on temporal and spatial scales. For instance, the probabilities of MD-to-GD propagation under light, moderate, severe, and extreme meteorological drought conditions were 38%, 43%, 48%, and 53%, respectively. The propagated drought occurrence probability was confirmed to be the highest under extreme antecedent drought conditions.

Cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS) constellation generates Delay-Doppler Maps (DDMs) that contain important Earth surface information from GNSS reflection measurements. DDMs are affected by soil moisture and other factors such as complex topography, soil texture, and overlying vegetation. Including entire DDM information can help reduce the uncertainty of SM estimation under different conditions along with remotely sensed geophysical data. This work extends our previously developed deep learning (DL) framework to a global scale by utilizing processed DDM measurements (analog power, effective scattering area, and bistatic radar cross-section) and ancillary data (elevation, slope, water percentage, soil properties, and vegetation water content). The DL model is trained and evaluated using the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission's enhanced SM products at 9-km resolution. This study comprehensively evaluates the DL model against publicly available CYGNSS-based SM products at a quasi-global scale. In addition to the typical comparison against in-situ measurements, a robust triple collocation technique is used to evaluate the DL-based SM product and other CYGNSS-derived SM products.;2151-1535;;10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3287591;"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2047771); Agricultural Research Service(grant numbers:NACA 58-6064-9-007); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10157977;"Convolutional neural network (CNN);cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS);deep learning (DL);global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R);soil moisture active passive (SMAP);soil moisture retrieval;triple collocation (TC)";"Land surface;Surface topography;Spatial resolution;Sea surface;Data models;Vegetation mapping;Surface treatment";"agriculture;deep learning (artificial intelligence);hydrological techniques;hydrology;moisture;radar cross-sections;remote sensing;satellite navigation;soil;vegetation";"cyclone global navigation satellite system constellation;CYGNSS-derived SM products;DDM measurements;DDMs;deep learning-based CYGNSS Soil Moisture retrieval;Delay-Doppler Maps;developed deep learning framework;enhancing agricultural applications;entire DDM information;global navigation satellite system signals;global scale;GNSS reflection measurements;high-resolution land surface information;important Earth surface information;L-band frequencies;meteorological processes;publicly available CYGNSS-based SM products;quasiglobal assessment;quasiglobal scale;SM estimation;SM product;Soil Moisture Active Passive mission;soil properties;soil texture;surface soil moisture;temporal resolution global soil moisture product;understanding hydrologic;vegetation water content";;;;52;CCBYNCND;20.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

High food productivity goals were nevertheless met by the green revolution, albeit at the expense of environmental damage such as soil deterioration and climate change. Crops are often recommended based on the weather, humidity, rainfall, and other parameters mechanically without any practical experience to increase agricultural productivity. One must have the knowledge of which crops may be planted effectively one after the other at any time since inappropriate implantation produces considerably more harm than benefit. The use of machine learning classifiers like System Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN to forecast which crop is optimal for which soil type based on data sets (n=100) like pH and yearly rainfall values is suggested in this paper. By comparing the results obtained through these pattern classifiers and determining their total accuracy rates, the crops such as wheat and ragi can be recommended. The results show KNN to have 98% accuracy in recommending the crop.

If left undetected, many diseases damage the plant, thus reducing the crop yield produced by such plants. Therefore, in this paper, two diseases have been worked on. The two tomato plant diseases that have been focused on are Tomato leaf mold and Tomato target spot. Past practices to detect these diseases have proven to be time-consuming and inefficient due to poor accuracy. The primary focus of this work is to mainly detect these diseases accurately and quickly, because such diseases need to be detected in the premature stage to avoid any major harm to the plant's yield. Proposed system is aimed at addressing the existing challenges. It accepts the image as an input that will be preprocessed and will undergo the detection and classification stages. Feature extraction plays a significant role in such systems. This research contribution mainly deals with training the system using deep learning (DL) models and spatial domain image processing technique namely Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) with ResNet50, DenseNet and histogram partitioning based Bins approach. The novelty added by applying Bins approach for feature extraction clearly defines the image contents being focused on as features which aids in choosing the significant features and ignoring the unwanted features that helps in reducing the feature dimensionality. Further it is followed by application of various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Linear SVM and Decision Trees over bins feature space. All the proposed algorithms are applied on a common dataset called PlantVillage and their performances are evaluated, analyzed and compared using the same set of parameters like precision, recall, accuracy and F1-score.

The development and growth of agricultural sectors will contribute to the Brunei Vision 2035 aim of achieving a dynamic and sustainable economy. However., because of the inability to adapt to climate change., growth has begun to slow down in recent years. Thus., cultivated crops are adversely impacted and destroyed during wet seasons. So., to prevent this issue., a small-scale project is devised to help save crops from heavy rains and increased temperatures. By applying this technological approach can automate the weather-controlling process to help small-scale farmers or individuals efficiently manage the farm., increase production capabilities., support a sustainable economy, and plan future tasks accordingly.

They can be incredibly beneficial but also harmful if used for illegal or malicious purposes like smuggling, illegal surveillance, terrorist attacks, industrial espionage, and privacy violation. Therefore, it’s important to regulate the use of drones and develop technology to detect and neutralize their misuse as well as strict laws and regulations to prevent them. A proposed design for a drone defense system utilizes a heat sensor and frequency jammer to detect and neutralize unauthorized drones. The system collects primary data by scanning all frequencies in use within a specific area and then compares this data to secondary data gathered by observing any illegal drone movements. By comparing primary and secondary data, the system can identify and jam any unauthorized frequencies in use.

Twenty-nine wheat varieties grown under natural light conditions were selected as the research objects, and a wheat seed dataset with the number of 4,385 seed photos was constructed by integrating sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions with a blue hard paper as the background plate, and using a Nikon COOLPIX B700 digital camera for dataset collection. Based on the above self-constructed dataset, improving the MobileNetV2 model proposed a new lightweight method (IRB-5-CA Net) for wheat seed recognition. IRB-5-CA Net specific improvements are listed below: adding  $5\times 5$  convolution to the bottleneck without using the shortcut structure and adding the Coord Attention to the bottleneck with using the shortcut structure. After training IRB-5-CA Net on the self-built dataset, the average accuracy, average recall, and F1 values are 99.5%, 99.6%, and 99.6%.

As a result, the majority of existing graph neural networks have a shallow depth of learning. Over-smoothing and information loss are two of the key issues that restrict graph neural networks from going deeper. As network depth goes up, the embeddings of all the nodes eventually converge on the same value, which separates output representations from input vectors and causes over-smoothing. Moreover, layers of graph pooling are required in a deep learning model to retrieve specified features for prediction, which results in some degree of information loss. In this research, we present a new and multi-scale approach for overcoming these constraints by using concepts from graph theory, namely learnable edge sampling and line graphs. An edge-sampling mechanism that selects a particular number of edges through a learning parameter before training reduces oversmoothing, and the issue of information loss is alleviated using a line graph technique that converts the original graph into a similar line graph. Our method of edge sampling preserves the core spectral features of the graph without affecting its fundamental structure.

By using large datasets of historical weather data and applying advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning models can learn to predict the weather with unprecedented accuracy. One of the key benefits of deep learning for weather prediction is its ability to capture complex relationships between different weather variables. Traditional weather prediction models are based on physical equations that describe the behaviour of the atmosphere. However, these equations are often too complex to be solved accurately, and it can only capture a limited number of weather variables. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can learn to predict the weather by directly analysing large datasets of historical weather data. This allows them to capture complex relationships between different weather variables that would be impossible to model using traditional methods. Another key benefit of deep learning for weather prediction is its ability to make predictions over long time horizons. Traditional weather prediction models are typically only accurate for a few days in the future. This is because the atmosphere is a chaotic system, and small changes in the initial conditions can lead to large changes in the forecast. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can learn to make predictions over longer time horizons by using a technique called “ensemble forecasting.” Ensemble forecasting involves training multiple deep learning models on different datasets and then averaging their predictions. This helps to reduce the impact of chaos in the atmosphere and improve the accuracy of long-range forecasts. Over all, deep learning has the potential to revolutionize weather prediction. By using large datasets of historical weather data and applying advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning models can learn to predict the weather with unprecedented accuracy.

Nevertheless, the rapid growth of IoT networks has introduced new security challenges, making them susceptible to a variety of attacks. In response, machine learning-driven intrusion detection approaches have been developed, which analyze IoT devices' behavior and communication patterns to detect and counteract suspicious activities. While these approaches exhibit high accuracy and low false alarm rates in static contexts, their performance stability in dynamic, evolving environments is yet to be determined. Model drift, the decline in a machine learning model's predictive capacity over time, is a crucial issue that can considerably affect machine learning-based intrusion detection systems if not identified and addressed promptly.

However, there present many challenges for the existing ultra-FGVC methods, firstly there are always not enough samples in the existing ultraFGVC datasets based on which the models can easily get overfitting. Secondly, in practice, we are likely to find new species that we have not seen before and need to add them to existing models, which is known as incremental learning. The existing methods solve these problems by Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), but the main challenge of the FSCIL models on ultra-FGVC tasks lies in their inferior discrimination detection ability since they usually use low-capacity networks to extract features, which leads to insufficient discriminative details extraction from ultrafine-grained images. In this paper, a self-supervised feature enhancement for the few-shot incremental learning network (SSFE-Net) is proposed to solve this problem. Specifically, a self-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation (KD) framework is developed to enhance the feature extraction of the low-capacity backbone network for ultra-FGVC few-shot class incremental learning tasks. Besides, we for the first time create a series of benchmarks for FSCIL tasks on two public ultra-FGVC datasets and three normal finegrained datasets, which will facilitate the development of the Ultra-FGVC community. Extensive experimental results on public ultra-FGVC datasets and other state-of-the-art benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.;2642-9381;978-1-6654-9346-8;10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00621;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10030400;"Algorithms: Image recognition and understanding (object detection;categorization;segmentation);Machine learning architectures;formulations;and algorithms (including transfer;low-shot;semi-;self-;and un-supervised learning);Agriculture";"Knowledge engineering;Visualization;Computer vision;Layout;Self-supervised learning;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing";"feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);supervised learning";"closely related species;existing ultra-FGVC methods;existing ultraFGVC datasets;feature extraction;few-shot class incremental learning tasks;few-shot incremental learning network;FSCIL models;FSCIL tasks;inferior discrimination detection ability;insufficient discriminative details extraction;low-capacity backbone network;low-capacity networks;popular problem;public ultra-FGVC datasets;same species;self-supervised feature enhancement;SSFE-Net;Ultra-FGVC community;ultra-FGVC tasks;Ultra-Fine-Grained Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning;Ultra-Fine-Grained Visual Categorization;ultrafine-grained images";;1;;43;IEEE;6.2.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Such an outbreak can cause enormous financial loss to the poultry farmers and induce food insecurity. The COVID-19 lessons have taught us that chicken disease outbreak can be a threat to human lives as well if not detected in time. Currently, Poultry farmers rely on their experience to detect diseases and to seek professional's help, which occasionally fails, resulting in widespread chicken death. Thus, early detection of chicken disease is of great importance for sustainable poultry farming, reducing poultry losses and preventing the spread of zoonotic diseases to humans.

However, those approaches still faced some limitations of processing time and precision when they are applied to large samples and hard datasets. Recently, some new methods based on the transformer learning approach have been applied to image processing. This direction approach has illustrated the promising results in the terms of accuracy and computational time. This paper presents a new approach, which combines a pre-processing technique of image filtering and vision transformer (ViT) learning for the problem of plant insect pests and diseases recognition. The proposed solution involves some stages: neural network-based image filtering, then passes results through a ViT module to extract feature map, and then fed to multiple head network for classification. The proposed method applies image filtering pre-processing to highlight features before passing results to the ViT processing stage instead of using ViT from raw input images. Furthermore, element-wise multiplication in the frequency domain reduces processing time instead of using convolutional processing in the spatial domain. Experimental results demonstrate that applying filtering preprocessing does not significantly increase the number of learning parameters and training time compared to using ViT directly and it leverages to improve accuracy to compare to well-known models based on deep CNN. The research results also illustrated that the ViT solution and the proposed method are reached more accurate than CNN-based deep learning methods.;2325-0925;979-8-3503-2294-1;10.1109/ICSSE58758.2023.10227192;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227192;"Vision transformer;image filter;smart agriculture;plant pests and diseases recognition";"Deep learning;Measurement;Training;Plant diseases;Image recognition;Transformers;Feature extraction";"convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image filtering;pest control;plant diseases";"CNN-based deep learning methods;computational time;convolutional neural network architecture;convolutional processing;deep CNN;direction approach;diseases recognition;element-wise multiplication;feature map;hard datasets;image filtering pre-processing;image processing;learning parameters;multiple head network;neural network-based image filtering;plant insect pests;pre-processing technique;precision criterion;processing time;raw input images;traditional machine learning methods;training time;transformer learning approach;vision transformer;ViT module;ViT processing stage;ViT solution;ViT technique";;;;20;IEEE;29.8.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The multispectral UAV flight missions with 30, 60, 90, and 120 m heights were conducted at the wheat grain filling phase in 2018 and 2019. To estimate AGB, we used the UAV-based crop surface model (CSM), spectral, texture indices, and their combinations along with a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN with AlexNet architecture), random forest, and support vector machine models. Results showed the CSM and textures exhibit sensitivity to flight height, with estimation accuracy declining by 48% and 41%, respectively, as the flight height increased from 30 to 120 m. Spectral indices displayed lesser sensitivity with accuracy decrease of 25%. Integrating data from different heights exhibited better performances in texture and spectral indices while reducing performance when CSM was input. The DCNN performed best particularly at high spatial image scales, whereas more sensitive to flight height, as the AGB estimation accuracy decreased by 30% and 47% from 30 to 120 m for machine learning and DCNN, respectively.

Although past to present regression-based, simulation-based and hybrid methods are proposed for agricultural yield estimation, Machine Learning (ML) methods have been used in recent years. Among the ML techniques, Deep Learning (DL) is one of the most prominent method recently. In DL techniques, either satellite data on which data reduction methods are applied, as well as weather, soil, etc. data or directly processed large satellite images are used. The aim of this study is to propose an efficient and fast DL architecture for corn yield estimation. In the study, only histogram-based satellite data and yield information were used. The proposed architecture combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)’s ability to learn depth dependent features and detect different feature sets using different kernel sizes in parallel.

Prior research focused on assessing the computation and communication ability of the client devices for selection in FL. On-device data quality, in terms of data volume and heterogeneity, across these distributed devices is largely overlooked. The obvious outcome is the selection of an improper subset of clients with poor-quallity data, which inevitably results in an inefficient trained model. With an aim to address this problem, in this work, we design DICE which prioritizes the data quality of the client devices in the selection phase, in addition to their computation and communication abilities, to improve the accuracy of FL. Additionally, in DICE, we introduce the assistance of vicinal edge devices to account for the lack of computation or communication abilities in certain devices without violating the privacy-preserving guarantees of FL. Towards this aim, we propose a scheme to decide the optimal edge device, in terms of latency and workload, to be selected as the helper device. The experimental results show that DICE improves convergence speed for a given level of model accuracy. Further, the simulation results show that DICE reduces delay by at least 16%, energy consumption by at least 17%, and packet loss by at least 55% compared to the existing benchmarks while prioritizing the on-device data quality across clients.;1558-2183;;10.1109/TPDS.2022.3217271;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9930629;"Client selection;distributed edge networks;federated learning;fog computing;offloading";"Computational modeling;Training;Servers;Data integrity;Data models;Performance evaluation;Data privacy";"cloud computing;computer networks;data handling;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence)";"client devices;data volume;data-centric client selection approach;DICE;distributed devices;distributed edge networks;federated learning;FL;helper device;on-device data quality;optimal edge device;poor-quallity data;privacy-preserving guarantees;vicinal edge devices";;6;;41;IEEE;26.10.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Recently, deep learning has been regarded as the best classification model for apple leaf pests and diseases. However, these models with large parameters have difficulty providing an accurate and fast diagnosis of apple leaf pests and diseases on mobile terminals. This paper proposes a novel and real-time early apple leaf disease recognition model. AD Convolution is firstly utilized to replace standard convolution to make smaller number of parameters and calculations. Meanwhile, a LAD-Inception is built to enhance the ability of extracting multiscale features of different sizes of disease spots. Finally, the LAD-Net model is built by the LR-CBAM and the LAD-Inception modules, replacing a full connection with global average pooling to further reduce parameters. The results show that the LAD-Net, with a size of only 1.25MB, can achieve a recognition performance of 98.58%. Additionally, it is only delayed by 15.2ms on HUAWEI P40 and by 100.1ms on Jetson Nano, illustrating that the LAD-Net can accurately recognize early apple leaf pests and diseases on mobile devices in real-time, providing portable technical support.;1557-9964;;10.1109/TCBB.2022.3191854;"Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021NY-138); CCF-Baidu Open Fund(grant numbers:2021PP15002000); Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2019ZDLNY07-06-01); Key Research and Development Project of Shaanxi province(grant numbers:2020NY098); China's National College Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Northwest A&F University(grant numbers:S202110712607); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832789;"Apple leaf pests and diseases;asymmetric convolution;dilated convolution;real-time inference;convolutional neural networks;deep learning";"Diseases;Servers;Performance evaluation;Kernel;Data models;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling";"convolutional neural nets;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;object detection;plant diseases";"AD convolution;deep learning;disease spots;diseases classification;early apple leaf pests;LAD-inception modules;LAD-Net model;light weight model;LR-CBAM;mobile terminals;real-time early apple leaf disease recognition model";"Malus;Plant Diseases;Plant Leaves";4;;39;IEEE;18.7.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Phase reconstruction is a task of recovering phase of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients only from the corresponding magnitude. However, phase is sensitive to waveform shifts and not easy to estimate from the magnitude even with a DNN. To overcome this problem, we propose to use DNNs for estimating differences of phase between adjacent time-frequency bins. We show that convolutional neural networks are suitable for phase difference estimation, according to the theoretical relation between partial derivatives of STFT phase and magnitude. The estimated phase differences are used for reconstructing phase by solving a weighted least squares problem in a frame-by-frame manner. In contrast to existing DNN-based phase reconstruction methods, the proposed framework is causal and does not require any iterative procedure.

We utilize available 3D object models to train classifiers that can generalize to real-world point clouds. We simulate the acquisition of point clouds by sampling 3D object models from multiple viewpoints and with arbitrary partial occlusions. We then augment the resulting set of point clouds through random rotations and adding Gaussian noise to better emulate the real-world scenarios. We then train point cloud encoding models on the synthesized and augmented datasets and evaluate their cross-domain classification performance on corresponding real-world datasets. We also introduce PointSyn2Real, a new benchmark dataset for cross-domain learning on point clouds.

Prior approaches explore knowledge sharing between classes to improve performance of unsupervised domain adaption methods. However these methods have inductive bias for prior tree or graph. And previous contrastive domain adaptation methods take center-based prototypes as positive samples which only coarsely characterize the domain structure, and fail to depict the local data structure. To fix these problems, we propose a novel framework called contrastive memory feature transfer (CMFT). To solve nonshared data sharing without inductive bias, we build a centroid memory based directed memory transfer mechanism to enhance imbalanced class features with similar nonshared class centroid. To address the imbalanced domain adaptation, we design a fault-tolerant and fine-grained neighborhood prototype for the contrastive learning which can narrow the domain shift.

There are a total of 9,000 turns, each language having 1,500 turns, which we translate from a portion of the English multi-domain MultiWOZ dataset. Subsequently, we benchmark by investigating & analyzing the effectiveness of modelling through transfer learning by utilziing state-of-the-art (SoTA) deep monolingual models: DialoGPT and BlenderBot. We compare the models with a simple seq2seq baseline using perplexity. Besides this, we conduct human evaluation of single-turn conversations by using majority votes and measure inter-annotator agreement (IAA). We find that the hypothesis that deep monolingual models learn some abstractions that generalize across languages holds. We observe human-like conversations, to different degrees, in 5 out of the 6 languages.

During the last decade, genome-wide polymorphism data have increased, which has raised concerns about storage cost and computational time. Several individual studies have attempted to compress the genome data and predict phenotypes. However, compression models lack adequate quality of data after compression, and prediction models are time consuming and use original data to predict the phenotype. Therefore, a combined application of compression and genomic prediction modeling using deep learning could resolve these limitations. A Deep Learning Compression-based Genomic Prediction (DeepCGP) model that can compress genome-wide polymorphism data and predict phenotypes of a target trait from compressed information was proposed. The DeepCGP model contained two parts: (i) an autoencoder model based on deep neural networks to compress genome-wide polymorphism data, and (ii) regression models based on random forests (RF), genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), and Bayesian variable selection (BayesB) to predict phenotypes from compressed information. Two datasets with genome-wide marker genotypes and target trait phenotypes in rice were applied. The DeepCGP model obtained up to 99% prediction accuracy to the maximum for a trait after 98% compression. BayesB required extensive computational time among the three methods, and showed the highest accuracy; however, BayesB could only be used with compressed data. Overall, DeepCGP outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of both compression and prediction.

In this paper, an improved method has proposed for deep learning-based analysis of environmental issues and remote sensing. This pollution creates harm to the biological nature of the environment. Global Positioning Module (GPRS) receivers transmit position, echo data and precision clocks carried by satellites to all stations. Since space has three dimensions, the smallest error in measuring the signals from the satellites with the 3 satellites namely position, time and velocity becomes huge even with clock correction. This is because the speed of the satellite during miscalculation can affect the correct positioning. So receivers can operate using 4 or more satellites without problems with location and time.;;979-8-3503-9846-5;10.1109/ICICACS57338.2023.10099699;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099699;"ecosystem;natural;environment;pollution;world;lifestyle;instability;harmful;noise;heat;light;energy";"Military communication;Satellites;Receivers;Air pollution;Water pollution;Trajectory;Nitrogen";"deep learning (artificial intelligence);ecology;environmental science computing;remote sensing";"biological nature;chemical substances;correct positioning;deep learning-based analysis;environmental damage;environmental issues;environmental pollution;Global Positioning Module receivers;harmful activities;living beings;natural environment;nonliving elements;precision clocks;remote sensing;satellites;term ecosystem;total living";;;;55;IEEE;19.4.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

HSIs have numerous dimensions, and obtaining the data is difficult. The issue of slow convergence of neural network training is brought on by high-dimensional data, and the neural network’s performance is impacted by the challenging data acquisition process. In order to achieve the effects of low data dependence and rapid convergence, we propose a redundancy elimination network architecture with a decoupled-gaze attention mechanism and phantom fractal modules (DGPF-RENet) for HSI classification. First, we propose the decoupled-gaze attention (DGA) mechanism to make full use of the correlation between adjacent bands and the continuity of neighboring pixels in HSIs. Then, a redundancy elimination module (REM) is proposed to reduce the number of feature points and eliminate redundant information while preserving the contextual information and relationships between pixels. Finally, the phantom fractal module (PFM) is proposed, which improves the scale of feature learning by fractalizing convolutions at multiple scales.

Even if it's not cost-effective or feasible to insulate your vehicle's walls, there are many inexpensive steps you can take to prepare for cold weather. Check your windows, doors, and seals for leaks or gaps anywhere. Replace. If your RV is motorized use heavy curtains on the windows to separate the cockpit and living quarters, as glass is no insulation from extreme temperatures. RV skirting is a very effective way to prevent air from drawing heat from inside your RV, and water tanks can freeze very quickly. In this paper, an intelligent estimation of solar photo-voltaic capacity measurement has proposed using solar machine learning model. To generate solar PV (photovoltaic) power, you will need to install solar panels on your property. Solar panels capture energy from the sun and convert it into electricity.

Technically, the misclassification phenomenon, as a serious performance degradation of generalization ability, often occurs in minority class. For this problem, borderline-synthetic minority oversampling technique (B-SMOTE), which aims to enrich the quantity of minority samples around decision boundaries, has received considerable attention. However, most imbalanced classification techniques under the framework of B-SMOTE generate instances by a random weight number from 0 to 1, which may result in an authentic reduction of newly born samples.

This study follows the footsteps of machine learning experts by introducing the state-of-the-art Yolov8 technology into the field of plant science. Moreover, we made some simple yet effective improvements. The integration of shallow-level information into the Path Aggregation Network (PANet) served to counterbalance the resolution loss stemming from the expanded receptive field. The enhancement of upsampled features was accomplished through combining the lightweight up-sampling operator Content-Aware ReAssembly of Features (CARAFE) with the Multi-Efficient Channel Attention (Mlt-ECA) technique to optimize the precision of upsampled features. This collective approach markedly amplified the discernment of small objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images, naming it Yolov8-UAV.

This article develops a hybrid neural network learning framework called convolutional smooth feedback fuzzy network (CSFFN) to detect a player's emotional states in real-time during a gaming process based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Specifically, CSFFN rationally combines a convolutional neural network (CNN), a fuzzy neural network (FNN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN). CNN not only captures spatial characteristics between EEG signals from different channels but also eliminates noise from EEG signals, improving the accuracy and anti-noise performance in game emotion recognition. FNN extracts the membership degree of a player's different emotional states, further improving the emotion recognition accuracy. Since a player's current emotional state is influenced by the previous emotional states during the game process, RNN is employed to capture the temporal characteristics of EEG signals, better improving the emotion recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that CSFFN has higher recognition accuracy and noise resistance in identifying four emotional states (happiness, sadness, superiority, and anger) compared to support vector machine (SVM) with different kernels, linear discrimination analysis (LDA), AlexNet, and VGG16 methods.;1949-3045;;10.1109/TAFFC.2020.3023966;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973126,61863028,81660299,61503177); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:2017A030306015); Guangdong special projects(grant numbers:2016TQ03X824); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019ZD27); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017B090914002); Innovation Team of the Modern Agriculture Industry Technology System in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019KJ139); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166006); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1700500); Science and Technology Department of Jiangxi Province of China(grant numbers:20161ACB21007,20171BBE50071,20171BAB202033); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9198145;"Electroencephalogram (EEG);game emotion recognition;games evaluation;feature extraction;classification";"Electroencephalography;Games;Emotion recognition;Convolution;Brain modeling;Fuzzy neural networks;Neural networks";"convolutional neural nets;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;recurrent neural nets;support vector machines";"anti-noise performance;captures spatial characteristics;CNN;convolutional neural network;convolutional smooth feedback fuzzy network;CSFFN;EEG signals;electroencephalogram signals;emotion recognition accuracy;emotion recognition method;FNN;fuzzy neural network;game emotion recognition;game evaluation;game process;gaming process;hybrid neural network learning framework;player;players-based emotion recognition;previous emotional states;recurrent neural network;understanding game players";;14;;39;IEEE;15.9.2020;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals
A Product Fuzzy Convolutional Network for Detecting Driving Fatigue;"G. Du; S. Long; C. Li; Z. Wang; P. X.

To address the issues, this article proposes a new type of the deep learning (DL) framework based on EEG and ECG called the product fuzzy convolutional network (PFCN). It should be noted that this article first investigates how to fuse EEG and ECG signals to deal with driving fatigue detection under noise conditions in both simulated and real-field driving environments. Specifically, the PFCN includes three subnetworks. The first uses a fuzzy neural network (FNN) with feedback and a product layer, effectively capturing the particularity and temporal variation of high-dimensional EEG signals and reducing the time-space complexity. The second subnetwork uses a 1-D convolution to convert the ECG data into feature sequences, providing high accuracy and low computational complexity in ECG data classification. The third subnetwork proposes a fusion-separation mechanism to effectively fuse the extracted ECG and EEG features, suppressing the noise interference and ensuring higher detection accuracy. To evaluate the performance of PFCN, a series of experiments has been set up in both simulated and real-field driving environments. The results indicate that the proposed PFCN model has better robustness and detection accuracy compared with several mainstream fatigue detection models.;2168-2275;;10.1109/TCYB.2021.3123842;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62173176,61973126,61863028); Innovation Team of the Modern Agriculture Industry Technology System in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019KJ139); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166006); Science and Technology Department of Jiangxi Province of China(grant numbers:20204ABC03A39); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714734;"Driving fatigue;electrocardiogram (ECG);electroencephalogram (EEG);noise reduction;product fuzzy convolutional network (PFCN)";"Electroencephalography;Fatigue;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Fuzzy neural networks;Electrooculography";"computational complexity;deep learning (artificial intelligence);electrocardiography;electroencephalography;fatigue;feature extraction;fuzzy neural nets;medical signal processing";"1-D convolution;deep learning framework;detection performance;driving fatigue;ECG data classification;ensuring higher detection accuracy;fatigue detection methods;fuzzy neural network;high-dimensional EEG signals;mainstream fatigue detection models;noise conditions;noise interference;PFCN;product fuzzy convolutional network;product layer;real-field driving environments;robustness;subnetwork";"Neural Networks, Computer;Electroencephalography;Electrocardiography";6;;47;IEEE;16.2.2022;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Adaptive filters typically operate via specialized online, iterative optimization methods such as least-mean squares or recursive least squares and aim to process signals in unknown or nonstationary environments. Such algorithms, however, can be slow and laborious to develop, require domain expertise to create, and necessitate mathematical insight for improvement. In this work, we seek to improve upon hand-derived adaptive filter algorithms and present a comprehensive framework for learning online, adaptive signal processing algorithms or update rules directly from data. To do so, we frame the development of adaptive filters as a meta-learning problem in the context of deep learning and use a form of self-supervision to learn online iterative update rules for adaptive filters. To demonstrate our approach, we focus on audio applications and systematically develop meta-learned adaptive filters for five canonical audio problems including system identification, acoustic echo cancellation, blind equalization, multi-channel dereverberation, and beamforming.We compare our approach against common baselines and/or recent state-of-the-art methods.

However, calculating global attention brings another disadvantage compared with convolutional neural networks, i.e. requiring much more data and computations to converge, which makes it difficult to generalize well on small datasets, which is common in practical applications. Previous works are either focusing on transferring knowledge from large datasets or adjusting the structure for small datasets. After carefully examining the self-attention modules, we discover that the number of trivial attention weights is far greater than the important ones and the accumulated trivial weights are dominating the attention in Vision Transformers due to their large quantity, which is not handled by the attention itself. This will cover useful non-trivial attention and harm the performance when trivial attention includes more noise, e.g. in shallow layers for some backbones. To solve this issue, we proposed to divide attention weights into trivial and non-trivial ones by thresholds, then Suppressing Accumulated Trivial Attention (SATA) weights by proposed Trivial WeIghts Suppression Transformation (TWIST) to reduce attention noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets show that our suppressing method boosts the accuracy of Vision Transformers by up to 2.3%.

In agricultural classification problems where there can be variations due to seasons and other elements, it is necessary to obtain quick solutions such as for performing yield estimation. The paper details an active learning approach using clustering for minimizing the number of labeled examples in the supervised classifier, by selecting only the most relevant examples to label manually. We propose to compare k-means and spectral clustering for the creation of the trained ground truth for a multi-layer perceptron. In addition, we compare three rotation invariant texture descriptors on each color channel: 1) Brightness, Contrast & Directed Gradients Information, 2) Color Histograms, and 3) Local Binary Patterns. Finally, we assess the impact of using RGB vs. HSV as the color model in the classification performance. The evaluation is performed on two data sets of images containing grape images of different sorts. The results show that it is possible to reach an accuracy of $\approx$ 95% while decreasing the number of blocks to label from 8504 to 50.

Asparagus stem blight disease and brown spot diseases have become increasingly serious, significantly reducing the yield of asparagus grown in large fields, and asparagus production has developed toward facility agriculture. To solve the problems of high labor costs, labor shortages, and low production efficiency faced by facility agriculture, the adoption of mechanized harvesting for asparagus is an inevitable trend. A prerequisite for mechanized harvesting is target detection. Compared with algorithms such as Faster R-CNN, which require the use features of candidate regions for classification and recognition and cannot meet the real-time requirements of mechanized harvesting, this paper proposes a YOLO-based asparagus recognition scheme that can quickly perform target detection with a detection accuracy of 85.45% and significantly enhanced interference resistance, which can greatly improve the production efficiency of facility agriculture and accelerate the mechanization process of facility agriculture.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3292530;"Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China project “Study on the comprehensive prevention and control of hemorrhagic fever based on spatial metrology and EOF model”(grant numbers:ZR201910220237); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173484;"Deep learning;image recognition;asparagus recognition;YOLO";"Feature extraction;Floods;Production;Object detection;Classification algorithms;Target recognition;Deep learning;Image recognition;Crops";;;;;;17;CCBYNCND;5.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals
An Intelligent Two-Layer Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Things;"M. M. Alani; A. I.

Significant advances in IoT networks have been hindered by security vulnerabilities and threats, which, if not addressed, can negatively impact the deployment and operation of IoT-enabled systems. This article addresses IoT security and presents an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. The system's intelligence is driven by machine learning techniques for intrusion detection, with the two-layer architecture handling flow-based and packet-based features. By selecting significant features, the time overhead is minimized without affecting detection accuracy. The uniqueness and novelty of the proposed system emerge from combining machine learning and selection modules for flow-based and packet-based features. The proposed intrusion detection works at the network layer, and hence, it is device and application transparent. In our experiments, the proposed system had an accuracy of 99.15% for packet-based features with a testing time of 0.357 ?s. The flow-based classifier had an accuracy of 99.66% with a testing time of 0.410 ?s. A comparison demonstrated that the proposed system outperformed other methods described in the literature.

Two Stage Job Title Identification System for Online Job Advertisements;"I. Rahhal; K. M. Carley; I. Kassou; M.

Analyzing the job market by classifying online job advertisements (ads) has recently received much attention. Various approaches for multi-label classification (e.g., self-supervised learning and clustering) have been developed to identify the occupation from a job advertisement and have achieved a satisfying performance. However, these approaches require labeled datasets with hundreds of thousands of examples and focus on specific databases such as the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) that are more adapted to the US job market. In this paper, we present a two-stage job title identification methodology to address the case of small datasets. We use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to first classify the job ads according to their corresponding sector (e.g., Information Technology, Agriculture). Then, we use unsupervised machine learning algorithms and some similarity measures to find the closest matching job title from the list of occupations within the predicted sector. We also propose a novel document embedding strategy to address the issues of processing and classifying job ads. Our experimental results show that the proposed two-stage approach improves the job title identification accuracy by 14% to achieve more than 85% in some sectors. Moreover, we found that incorporating document embedding-based approaches such as weighting strategies and noise removal improves the classification accuracy by 23.5% compared to approaches based on the Bag of words model. Further evaluations verify that the proposed methodology either outperforms or performs at least as well as the state-of-the-art methods. Applying the proposed methodology to Moroccan job market data has helped identify emerging and high-demand occupations in Morocco.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247866;"Fulbright Program; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10050019;"BERT;job market analysis;job title classification;job title identification;machine learning;natural language processing";"Market research;Text categorization;Employment;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Bit error rate;Data mining;Personnel;Machine learning;Natural language processing";"learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;supervised learning;unsupervised learning";"classifying job ads;closest matching job title;clustering;data science techniques;incorporating document embedding-based approaches;job advertisement;job title identification accuracy;Moroccan job market data;multilabel classification;Occupational Information Network;online job advertisements;self-supervised learning;stage job title identification system;two-stage approach;two-stage job title identification methodology;unsupervised machine learning algorithms;US job market";;;;65;CCBYNCND;22.2.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

To improve the drones’ communication in real-time scenarios, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can be used. RIS is a promising technology for empowering millimeter-waves and sub-millimeter waves communication. It also can provide improved communication links with significantly higher received signal strength in non-line-of-sight situations, which should be taken into account by drones to decide when and with which other drone(s) to perform computation offloading. To this end, we provide two federated learning-based computation offloading strategies through direct and indirect communications. These approaches are based on an advanced rating technique including some key computation and communication parameters. The core of the algorithm also involves two separate deep learning models that are helpful to efficiently transfer and update the decreased model weights, drones’ properties, angle of arrival, and angle of departure.

Digital Technologies for Integrated Food Loss and Waste Reduction in Agrifood Chains in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Scoping Review;M. S. Achieng;Dept Digital Transformation and Innovation, Graduate School of Business Leadership, University of South Africa, Midrand, South Africa;2023 IST-Africa Conference (IST-Africa);25.7.2023;2023;;;1;11;Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is grappling with a food insecurity crisis exacerbated by the decline in agriculture production and food loss and waste (FLW) that requires immediate attention. The challenge of declining agricultural production and FLW in agrifood chains has devastating consequences ranging from farmers and retailers losing income to the region’s population’s well-being. Given the critical challenge of food insecurity in SSA, this review paper explores prospective opportunities for digital technologies application in agrifood chains to facilitate an integrated approach to FLW reduction management. The scoping review 5-stage framework is employed to select relevant articles from Google scholar database over a 10-year timeframe period (2013-2022). The findings suggest that digital technologies such as Internet of Things, big data analytics, and Artificial Intelligence can help to reduce FLW by increasing efficiency, improving coordination, and connectivity in the agrifood chain phases, and thus creating value added transformation in agrifood chains. However, contextual factors such as inadequate digital skills, digital divide and connectivity issues that hinder effective use of technologies in SSA must be addressed if the region is to realise their transformative potential. This paper aims to add to the body of knowledge by highlighting potential opportunities to use digital technology to facilitate FLW reduction in SSA, to address crisis of food insecurity in SSA and, by extension, Africa.;2576-8581;978-1-905824-71-7;10.23919/IST-Africa60249.2023.10187757;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10187757;"Digital technology;Agrifood chains;Food loss and waste management;Africa;Agriculture digitalization";"Food waste;Waste reduction;Databases;Africa;Production;Big Data;Distance measurement";;;;;;40;;25.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Battery-powered multiunmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) systems possess limited computation and communication resources, significantly reducing their functional dimension by limiting mission time and range. To address this issue, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL)-based intelligent and decentralized task offloading scheme for resource-constrained UAVs that can enhance the operational capability of the MUAV systems. Moreover, the proposed FDRL scheme can improve offloading policy quality while preserving data privacy in MUAV. However, such intelligent systems may fall prey to backdoor attacks that can intervene in the system’s regular operation causing rapid degradation of its performance. We introduce a novel triggerless backdoor attack scheme on intelligent task offloading UAVs and analyze its impact to gauge the resiliency of the offloading policy in the presence of an adversary. Then, we propose lightweight agnostic defense mechanisms to combat such backdoors in multi-UAV settings.

Toward the Vectorization of Hyperspectral Imagery;"L. Fang; Y. Yan; J. Yue; Y. Deng";"College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China; School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China; School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China";IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing;8.8.2023;2023;61;;1;14;Hyperspectral images (HSIs) can provide rich spectral–spatial information that has been widely utilized in many fields, such as national defense, mineralogy, and agriculture. Most of the recent HSI interpretation methods are conducted in the raster pattern, which results in high memory costs, amplification distortion, and difficulties in topological editing. To address this issue, a novel end-to-end vectorization framework is proposed, called as the HSI vectorization network (HSI-VecNet), which learns a vector representation from spectral–spatial information through cross-level interactions. Specifically, this framework integrates low-level geometry information and high-level semantic instance information, which consists of two branches: the HSI semantic instance segmentation (HSIS) and the spectral-spatial junction prediction (SSJP). The HSIS conducts the raster-based classification and extracts the semantic information of each object in the HSI. In addition, the SSJP exploits spectral–spatial information to predict the positions of junctions in the HSI. The instance information of each object and the relations of junctions are then fused to vectorize the HSI. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, four hyperspectral datasets are vectorially labeled. Experimental results on these datasets demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end HSI-VecNet outperforms existing post-process vectorization methods.

In the existing deep learning methods based on spatial–spectral features, the features extracted from different layers are treated fairly in the learning process. In reality, features extracted from the continuous layers contribute differentially to the final classification, such as large tracts of woodland and agriculture typically count on shallow contour features, whereas deep semantic spectral features have meaningful constraints for small entities like vehicles. Furthermore, the majority of existing classification algorithms employ a patch input scheme, which has a high probability to introduce pixels of different categories at the boundary. To acquire more accurate classification results, we propose a spatial–spectral saliency reinforcement network (Sal2RN) in this article. In spatial dimension, a novel cross-layer interaction module (CIM) is presented to adaptively alter the significance of features between various layers and integrate these diversified features. Moreover, a customized center spectrum correction module (CSCM) integrates neighborhood information and adaptively modifies the center spectrum to reduce intraclass variance and further improve the classification accuracy of the network. Finally, a statistically based feature weighted combination module is constructed to effectively fuse spatial, spectral, and LiDAR features.

However, the wide and frequent occurrence of clouds highly undermines the quality and availability of usable optical data, particularly low-temporal-resolution data. Although deep learning techniques have facilitated recent progress in cloud removal algorithms, thick cloud removal under changing land cover remains challenging. In this study, we propose a framework to remove thick clouds, thin clouds, and cloud shadow from Sentinel-2 images. The framework integrates the spatial detail in a Sentinel-2 reference image and the coarse spectral pattern in a near-target-date Sentinel-3 image as spatiotemporal guidance to generate missing data with land cover change information in a cloudy Sentinel-2 image. The reconstruction is performed using a spatiotemporal attention network (STAN) that adopts the self-attention mechanism, residual learning, and high-pass features to enhance feature extraction from the multisource data. The experimental results show that STAN outperforms residual u-net (ResUnet), cloud-removal network (CRN), convolutional neural network-based spatial–temporal–spectral (STS-CNN), and DSen2-CR in terms of multiple quantitative metrics and visual characteristics. The comparative experiment proves that the integration of Sentinel-3 data improves the cloud removal performance, especially in areas with distinctive and heterogeneous land cover changes under large-scale cloud cover. The experimental results also indicate high generalizability of STAN when the Sentinel-3 image is far from the target date, when transferring features to cloud removal for new images, and even with limited training data that simulates severe cloud cover.;1558-0644;;10.1109/TGRS.2023.3236106;"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1510400,2022YFB3903700); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Report(grant numbers:2019QZKK0308); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:AoE/E-603/18); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42271439); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015046;"Cloud removal;deep learning;land cover change;Sentinel imagery;spatiotemporal attention network (STAN)";"Clouds;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Remote sensing;Soft sensors;Optical imaging";"clouds;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;spatiotemporal phenomena;terrain mapping";"cloud removal algorithms;cloud removal performance;cloud shadow;cloudy Sentinel-2 image;coarse spectral pattern;convolutional neural network;deep learning techniques;DSen2-CR;heterogeneous land cover changes;high-pass features;land cover change information;large-scale cloud cover;low-temporal-resolution data;multisource data;multisource satellite imagery;near-target-date Sentinel-3 image;remote sensing satellites;residual learning;self-attention mechanism;Sentinel-2 reference image;Sentinel-3 data;severe cloud cover;spatiotemporal attention network;spatiotemporal guidance;STAN;thick cloud removal;usable optical data";;1;;60;IEEE;11.1.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Apart from network connectivity, rural areas are predicted to have demands for diverse real-time intelligent communication services, such as smart agriculture and digital forestry. The effectiveness of real-time decision-making applications depends on the timely updating of sensing data measurements used in generating decisions. As a performance metric capable of quantifying the freshness of transmitted information, the age of information (AoI) can evaluate the freshness-aware performance of the process of updating sensory data. However, unlike urban areas, the available communication resources in rural areas may not allow for maintaining dedicated infrastructures for different types of services, e.g., conventional non-freshness-aware services and freshness-aware real-time services, thereby requiring the proper resource allocation among different services. In this article, we first introduce the anticipated services and discuss the advances of rural networks. Next, a case study on the efficient resource allocation across heterogeneous services characterized by AoI and data rate in HAP networks is presented. We also explore the potential of employing the free-space optical (FSO) backhaul framework to enhance the performance of multi-layer HAP networks. To strike a balance between the AoI and data rate, we develop both static and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dynamic resource allocation schemes to allocate the communication resources provided by HAP networks. The simulation results show that the proposed dynamic DRL-based method outperforms the heuristic algorithm and can surpass the performance ceiling achieved by the proposed static allocation scheme. In particular, our presented method can improve performance by nearly 2.5 times more than the ant colony optimization (ACO) method in terms of weighted sum performance improvements.

Generally, participants provide their own private datasets to efficiently train the distributed models on real-world data, which inevitably leads to privacy and security concerns. Without uploading raw training data, Federated Learning enables large-amount nodes to train a distributed model and preserves security and privacy of user sensitive information. However, Federated Learning is limited by expensive computational costs during collective parameter server aggregation. Moreover, malicious nodes among computing nodes interfere model training to some extent and further cause the leakage of data privacy.

The early detection of plant stress using new technologies and even more utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors is significant for the growers to act as early as a problem is in the nascent. Furthermore, the insights from the early detection of plant stress can be used as actionable data for fertilization and pesticide optimization. Our proposed state-of-the-art method uses Thermal Infrared (TIR) and high-resolution visible-spectrum (RGB) images acquired by IoT sensors of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from two experiment vineyards (Vitis vinifera L.) for two years in a total of twelve flights. The OTSU method is used for the plants’ canopy isolation from the soil. The k-Means clustering is used in the relative temperature values of the plant’s canopy to detect the leaves’ stomatal closure. The clusters’ pixel coordinates of the TIR image, which represents leaves’ stressed areas, are used, and a pseudo-coloring of yellow is assigned in the corresponding pixels of the aligned RGB image. Finally, an RGB image is generated with yellow pseudo-coloring over the stressed areas of the vineyards’ canopy. The stressed plants caused by abiotic and biotic factors were validated and compared with the Triangular Greenness Index (TGI), which measures the leaf chlorophyll content like other multispectral indexes. Finally, the proposed method shows significantly higher accuracy and precision than TGI based on the two years of experimentation results, considering that the F1-score of the proposed method is better than TGI in the cumulative of the two years by 70.55%.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3320048;"Hellenic Academic Libraries Link; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265270;"Internet of Things (IoT);thermal infrared (TIR);crop stress;precision viticulture;remote sensing;temperature;transpiration";"Stress;Temperature measurement;Crops;Sensors;Cameras;Temperature sensors;Soil;Internet of Things;Thermal management;Infrared heating";"agriculture;autonomous aerial vehicles;crops;image capture;image colour analysis;image segmentation;Internet of Things;pesticides";"abiotic factors;abiotic plant stress;abiotic stress;aligned RGB image;IoT sensors;leaves;stressed areas;stressed plants;Thermal RGB images captured;Things sensors;TIR image;vineyards";;;;58;CCBYNCND;27.9.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals
Risk Assessment of Agricultural Soil Heavy Metal Pollution Under the Hybrid Intelligent Evaluation Model;"X. Chen; C. Zhang; K. Yan; Z. Wei; N. Cheng";"School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China; School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China; School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China";IEEE Access;6.10.2023;2023;11;;106847;106858;As a nationally protected land resource, farmland plays a crucial role in agriculture production and food safety, making the quality of soil and environmental health critically important. Therefore, studying the extent of soil heavy metal pollution in farmland is of great significance for understanding the growth environment of food crops and protecting agricultural land resources. This study addresses the challenge of accurately, quickly, and conveniently assessing the extent of soil heavy metal pollution across an entire research area using a limited number of soil samples. To tackle this issue, a novel soil heavy metal pollution risk hybrid intelligent evaluation model (HIEM) is proposed. The HIEM utilizes the Semi-Supervised Bayesian Regression (Semi-BR) model, trained through Bayesian Co-training, to predict the soil heavy metal content at unsampled points. It employs an improved Multiple Kernel Support Vector Machine (MKSVM) model to evaluate the pollution status of the soil. Additionally, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques are employed for spatial analysis of the pollution situation in the research area. The study focuses on eight soil heavy metals: As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Zn, Cu, and Ni. The experimental verification of the model was conducted using field sampling data from the major agricultural areas of Huangpi and Xinzhou in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The experimental results show that the eastern region of Huangpi District is more severely contaminated, particularly the central area in the northeast, with moderate to high pollution levels. The hybrid intelligent evaluation model achieves an average accuracy of 96.66% in assessing single-factor pollution of the eight soil heavy metals and an overall evaluation accuracy of 97.42%. The hybrid intelligent evaluation model is able to accurately fit traditional single-factor index methods and Nemerow comprehensive pollution index method. The Geographic Information System representation reveals a consistent distribution trend of soil heavy metal pollution reflected by the hybrid intelligent evaluation model with the results obtained from single-factor index and Nemerow comprehensive pollution index evaluation, indicating the feasibility of using this evaluation method for assessing the risk of soil heavy metal pollution. The conclusion shows that the hybrid intelligent evaluation model needs at least 639 sets of sample data to achieve the highest accuracy when assessing the risk of soil heavy metal contamination in an area of about  $3.7\times 10^{4}\,\,hm^{2}$ , and this paper provides a reference to solve the problem of realizing high-precision risk assessment of heavy metal contamination of agricultural soils in the case of small samples.

This limitation stems from the fixed query set size of the transformer decoder, which restricts the model’s inference capacity. To overcome this challenge, we propose Recurrent Detection Transformer (Recurrent DETR), an object detector that iterates the decoder block to render more predictions with a finite number of query tokens. Recurrent DETR can adaptively control the number of decoder block iterations based on the image’s crowdedness or complexity, resulting in a variable-size prediction set. This is enabled by our novel Pondering Hungarian Loss, which helps the model to learn when additional computation is required to identify all the objects in a crowded scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Recurrent DETR on two datasets: COCO 2017, which represents a standard setting, and CrowdHuman, which features a crowded setting. Our experiments on both datasets show that Recurrent DETR achieves significant performance gains of 0.8 AP and 0.4 AP, respectively, over its base architectures.

Various satellites orbiting the earth measure the wind speed, which is particularly useful as they provide measurements of wind speed over large areas and in remote locations that might be difficult to measure using other methods. However, satellite-based wind speed measurements have relatively low spatial resolution compared to other methods, such as ground-based radar. In this research, we develop WindSR and a lightweight tiny-WindSR to improve the resolution of satellite wind speed data by four times from the NASA’s GEOS-5 Nature Run dataset. WindSR has SRResNet-based architecture consisting of several Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks to compute features from low spatial resolution (28 km) wind speed for upscaling. We train WindSR with more than 20,000 pairs of low-resolution (28 km) and corresponding high-resolution (7 km) wind speed data and evaluate its performance on the validation set consisting of 2,102 wind speed images. Experimental results show that WindSR outperforms classical upsampling algorithms, such as Bicubic interpolation and Lanczos interpolation by 17.89% and general-purpose super-resolution GANs such as BSRGAN and SwinIR by up to 11.35% on the RMSE metric.

Sendra;Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain;2023 International Conference on Multimedia Computing, Networking and Applications (MCNA);24.7.2023;2023;;;4;4;Digital agriculture is revolutionizing the global agricultural sector, aiming to optimize productivity, enhance competitiveness, and mitigate the negative effects on the environment. Precision agriculture, on one hand, is increasingly being adopted in larger areas, while the process of digital transition involves monitoring crops and incorporating artificial intelligence and other technologies to enable more efficient management practices. Therefore, it is crucial to showcase the manifold benefits of digitalization to farmers, ensuring the development of a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Furthermore, obtaining accurate and up-to-date information about farming sites offers significant advantages to researchers, the educational community, and even promotes the emergence of agricultural tourism. This speech aims to explore diverse approaches that facilitate the adoption of digitalization in agriculture. Disruptive technologies such as Low Power Wireless Area Networks (LPWAN) can be combined with other established short-range wireless technologies within a heterogeneous network. Additionally, the integration of multispectral images, 3D point-cloud maps, and AI-powered algorithms capable of processing massive amounts of data (AI and Big Data) can create a comprehensive system that enhances vital aspects such as the sustainability of agricultural activities, reduction in the utilization of natural resources, and increased public awareness of these issues. The exchange of knowledge between farmers and experts will yield valuable recommendations to support their transition to more ecologically sustainable farming practices.;;979-8-3503-3927-7;10.1109/MCNA59361.2023.10185764;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185764;;;"agriculture;artificial intelligence;Big Data;crops;ecology;Internet of Things;sustainable development;travel industry";"agricultural activities;agricultural tourism;competitive agricultural sector;digital agriculture;digital transition;disruptive technologies;ecologically sustainable farming practices;efficient management practices;farmers;global agricultural sector;incorporating artificial intelligence;keynote speech 4;larger areas;Low Power Wireless Area Networks;monitoring crops;precision agriculture;short-range wireless technologies;sustainable sector";;;;;IEEE;24.7.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
Applications of electronic nose and machine learning models in vegetables quality assessment: A review;"H. Anwar; T. Anwar; M. S. Murtaza";"Department of Food Science and Technology, MNS-University of Agriculture, Multan, Pakistan; Independent Researcher, Multan, Pakistan; Department of Food Science and Technology, MNS-University of Agriculture, Multan, Pakistan";2023 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering, Sciences and Technology (ICES&T);2.6.2023;2023;;;1;5;Vegetables are an integral part of a balanced diet. They are good source of nutrition enriched with vitamins, mineral and antioxidants. They are prone to spoilage after harvesting without proper storage. Their quality can be determined by chemical analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography and near-infrared detection method. These methods are time taking, required a high cost equipment and trained person to perform. This article discussed the basic concept of electronic nose and machine learning. Electronic nose is used to detect gases excreted from vegetables and produced electronic signals. Machine learning is trained on these signals and predict the quality of vegetables. This paper presents the application of an electronic nose system with machine learning models. It is studied that this method is a cost-effective, portable and potential upcoming technique to overcome quality issues in vegetables.;;978-1-6654-5560-2;10.1109/ICEST56843.2023.10138839;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138839;"Vegetable;Electronic Nose;Machine Learning;Quality;Diseases";;"agricultural products;chromatography;electronic noses;food products;food safety;learning (artificial intelligence);product quality";"antioxidants;balanced diet;chemical analysis;detection method;electronic nose system;electronic signals;high cost equipment;high-performance liquid chromatography;machine learning models;mineral;proper storage;trained person;vegetables quality assessment";;;;;IEEE;2.6.2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
