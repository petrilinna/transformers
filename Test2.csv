Abstract
According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the world population is expected to reach 9.73 billion by 2050, increasing the demand for agricultural needs proportionately. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which provide high productivity and accurate farming operations to meet the need for food, are being used in Smart Agriculture to replace traditional farming techniques. In recent years, experimenters in smart agriculture have drawn more attention. Anybody interested in farming would be able to strive towards results that are based on data-driven judgements with the correct advice, perceptivity, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) -powered perfection agricultural outputs. The first half of this paper examines how to provide users with accurate, useful, and automated results for substantiated backing and guidance based on the collected data in the users’ native tongue. An AI Chatbot operation with a user-friendly interface and the alternative section can do this. From the standpoint of ecological and environmental protection, a crop complaint and pest identification model based on deep learning is proposed in order to address the issues of numerous types of crop conditions and pests, quick prolixity speed, and time-consuming manual identification of conditions and pests.
Agriculture, encompassing industrialization, security, traceability, and sustainable resource management, is critical to the survival of humans. As resources dwindle, it is critical to develop strategies to assist in preserving agriculture. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial intelligence, UAVs, and Blockchain technologies as new sectors has the potential to significantly improve the status of the Agricultural domain. In this context, this study does a comprehensive assessment of the literature to analyse the most recent breakthroughs in schemes that can innovate the agriculture domain. Following the determination of the fundamental needs in smart agriculture, several solutions and projects are highlighted. Furthermore, the present investigation will help in the identification of new avenues for future research related to the employment of AI, UAVs, and BC in agriculture.
Internet of Things (IoT) connects technological devices through cloud databases and virtual network connectivity. The emerging new IoT apps that monitor, control, and coordinate agricultural and livestock production value chains are going to transform the agriculture industry. Despite the fact that there are various types of IoT systems for agriculture, no industry-wide standard for connecting numerous applications has yet to be proposed. This article discusses about the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) system and large cloud network in the agricultural value chain. AI and IoT technologies can develop a network of commercial agriculture network, which will increase the agricultural production and sustainability.
The world is surrounded by enormous amount of data almost generated at an unpredictable velocity, in huge volume, variety and veracity. Our traditional systems, however have not yet reached a state where they can efficiently use every bit of this Big data and incorporate it to derive consistent information. Data Fusion is one such technique which can help us achieve this goal. It can be applied to various fields, however for the scope of this paper we have focused on its implementation in Precision Agriculture. While remote sensing has played a major role in precision agriculture by harnessing satellite data as a non-destructive way of information retrieval. The data collected from these satellite varies widely depending on the technique, spatial resolution, temporal resolution, spectral range, viewing geometry of the sensors, thus providing us different amounts of information for different use cases, some in which makes it quiet challenging for the researchers to harness all the information available to attain higher levels of precision, as high as to be able to classify at a sub pixel level while retaining the efficiency and feasibility of the solution. one of the major pain point in agriculture is monitoring large fields and gauging their crop density per square meter. While crop density of a field depends hugely of the soil quality, moisture, fertilizer percentage knowing crop density can have a great impact on yield prediction, sustainable fertilization and overall better through put of a field. Thus, in this paper we have explored the possibility of fusing data from different sensors using CNN based Data Fusion Algorithm to retrieve crop density and segregate patches of field as sparse or dense respectively. The results are quite encouraging.
Technologies like AI and IoT have been employed in farming for some time now, along with other forms of cutting-edge computer science. There has been a shift in recent years toward thinking about how to put this new technology to use. Agriculture has provided a large portion of humanity’s sustenance for thousands of years, with its most notable contribution being the widespread use of effective agricultural practices for several crop types. The advent of cutting-edge IoT know-how with the ability to monitor agricultural ecosystems and guarantee high-quality production is underway. Smart Sustainable Agriculture continues to face formidable hurdles due to the widespread dispersion of agricultural procedures, such as the deployment and administration of IoT and AI devices, the sharing of data and administration, interoperability, and the analysis and storage of enormous data quantities. This work initially analyses existing Internet-of-Things technologies used in Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA) to discover architectural components that might facilitate the development of SSA platforms. This paper examines the state of research and development in SSA, pays attention to the current form of information, and proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) framework as a starting point for SSA.

This article focuses on a few GST features enabled by AI and offers recommendations for enhancing the current tools. The implementation of the good and service tax is the foundation of artificial competition. It lessens tax avoidance and increases transparency among entrepreneurs, common people, and customers. The pre-GST era saw a wide variety of taxation methods, the majority of which relied on physical labor. This study focused on the artificial aspects of electronic participation that facilitate straightforward procedures. Electronic Invoice is an important part which curd tax evasion. The study emphasized E- Invoice and highlighted future recommendations.
Artificial intelligence is the primary force behind the present digital transition (AI). There is no denying that AI has tremendous potential to help both people and the environment. Almost in every aspect of life, from agricultural and forest ecosystems that have an impact on our whole planet to the health of every single person, AI can undoubtedly assist in identifying innovative answers to the most serious problems confronting our human civilization. This paper, emphasises a very distinct feature. Despite all its advantages, the widespread use of AI technology also carries a huge and unanticipated risk for brand-new, unexpected hazards. The adoption of trustworthy, ethical AI must be ensured by all parties concerned, and the incorrect use of AI technology must be avoided. To achieve this goal, it is essential to consciously ensure that AI systems always adhere to human values and promote a safe and secure society for all. This article explores some of the challenges associated with this objective and emphasizes the importance of prioritizing safety and security as fundamental concerns in two specific application domains: smart agriculture and smart health.
